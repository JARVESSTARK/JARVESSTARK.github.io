<p><strong>Sorting your waste is not only good practice, but an obligation. Unfortunately, there’s often doubt which bin to choose. How do you recycle according to the regulations and how does it serve our planet? Here are some explanations and tips.</strong><br></p>



<p>Hats off to those who limit their daily waste production. Whether we call this the less waste trend, eco-awareness or internal need, each of us should reduce waste to the minimum. Let’s face it though – less doesn’t mean none. It’s rather impossible not to produce any garbage in our daily life. Sooner or later, some of our shopping and everyday activities will result in filling the bin. And it should be the right one. </p>



<h2>Why Recycle?</h2>



<p>Do you know how much communal waste was produced last year by an average resident of Poland? 315 kg! This means nearly 1 kg of rubbish every day. What is equally disturbing is the fact that only 37% of that was recycled. It’s far from enough as 80% of our rubbish can be reused.</p>



<p>Environmental issues aside, from the economic perspective, recycling means considerable savings – not just globally, but also individually. Since January 1st 2020, all Polish cities are obliged to recycle 50% of communal waste. Simply put – half of the garbage that lands in our bins should be recycled. As people are easily motivated by awards (and, less fortunately, punishment), since 2020 the non-recycled waste costs us a pretty penny. And so in Katowice the charge per each person in a recycling household is 21.30 a month, while in the non-recycling ones – twice as much.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the cost of non-recycling is also born by our environment. The spreading landfills, greenhouse gas emission, soil and water contamination, fire hazard – are but a few of the considerable threats initiated by each of us.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Recycle?</strong></h2>



<p>The simplest answer is: do something, regularly and consistently, starting at home. Whether it’s a small apartment downtown or a large country house, the obligation to recycle applies to everybody. A small kitchen is no excuse, as a wide range of recycling bins of various shapes and sizes are on offer in any hardware store and online. For recycling, you can also use paper bags and cardboard boxes, or simply put all recyclables in one place and sort them directly into proper bins. Done regularly, it surely won’t garbage-swamp your apartment?</p>

<p>The important thing is to sort the waste into glass (green bin), paper (blue), metal + plastics (yellow), mixed (black) and bio (brown). It’s not always obvious which bin to choose. Sometimes, the color doesn’t match the use, but the bin is still marked in another way. No excuses, the ball is in our court. Let the sorting begin!</p>



<h2><strong>Not All That Shatters Is Glass</strong></h2>



<p>Glass recycling is one of the most economically and ecologically beneficial recycling processes. Its products maintain all the original properties and quality. Additionally, the cullet used for manufacturing new items melts at a lower temperature than the raw materials in the initial production. Recycling glass saves energy, water, and natural resources (including quartz sand).</p>



<p>What’s important, not every item that shatters and is commonly considered glass can be recast. Various melting temperatures and compositions make some glass non-recyclable: window glass, light bulbs, also drinking glasses.</p>

<h4><br><strong>What glass goes in the green bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>glass bottles – clear and color (yes, wine bottles also;))</li><li>food jars (without metal lids)</li><li>glass cosmetics containers</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What is not allowed in the green bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>drinking glasses</li><li>tableware</li><li>window glass and mirrors</li><li>bulbs</li><li>grave candles</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled glass?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>glass containers</li><li>optical glass</li><li>construction materials</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Paper Fight For Trees</strong></h2>



<p>It’s estimated that the world produces 10 tons of paper per second. Despite the increasing popularity of the on-line issues of our favorite magazines and books, as well as numerous campaigns against unnecessary printing of documents, paper use in Poland is almost twice the world average.</p>



<p>The good news is that paper can be recycled up to 4 times. The recycled material won’t be as smooth and snow-white as the first grade, because the cellulose fibers gradually decrease in quality. However, grey paper or cardboard do have a range of applications, while recycling 1 ton of paper helps save 17 trees, that is&nbsp; 1 acre of forest (that’s how much it takes to produce 1 ton of paper).</p>



<p>In order to sort paper properly, you need to pay attention to the daily rubbish that is usually thoughtlessly tossed into the bin. The blue recycling bin shouldn’t contain tissues or paper towels, nor shopping receipts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="4105" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=4105" class="wp-image-4105" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Paper shopping bags are an eco-friendly choice.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4><br><strong>What paper goes in the blue bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>newspapers and magazines</li><li>office paper: printed paper, brochures, leaflets, envelopes</li><li>books (which we suggest you give away rather than bin;))</li><li>unsoiled cardboard packaging</li><li>cardboard</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What is not allowed in the blue bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>used tissues and paper towels</li><li>shopping receipts</li><li>soiled and greasy cardboard packaging (like a pizza box)</li><li>milk or juice cartons</li><li>coated paper</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled paper?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>egg boxes</li><li>coffee filters</li><li>toilet paper and disposable towels</li><li>office paper</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Metal Saves Energy</strong></h2>



<p>Metal is perfect for recycling. The most popular recyclables are steel and aluminium as they maintain their properties despite numerous reprocessing cycles. This is especially important in aluminium production which uses a non-renewable element – bauxite.</p>



<p>Metal recycling is not only a pro-ecological procedure, but also a business necessity. It responds to market demand, limiting the production costs, and saving the natural metal deposits. Do you know that 75% of aluminium manufactured to date remains in circulation worldwide? Disposing proper waste into the yellow bin you contribute to these statistics.</p>



<h4><br><strong>What metals go in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>metal bottle caps and lids</li><li>food tins</li><li>aluminium soda cans&nbsp;</li><li>aluminium foil</li></ul>



<p><em>Remember that metal and plastics go in the same yellow bin!</em></p>



<h4><br><strong>What is not allowed in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>paint and oil cans</li><li>large-size scrap metal and wires</li><li>used batteries</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled metal?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>car parts</li><li>aluminium cans and containers</li><li>pipes</li><li>metal kitchenware</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Plastic Deluge</strong></h2>



<p>Plastic is the plague of our times. Still, you must admit, they make our daily life easier and are hard to give up. Let’s use them, but in moderation, knowing that once produced, plastic will remain on earth for many generations. That’s how long it takes for a plastic bottle or a regular (and, unfortunately, also disposable) plastic bag to decompose.</p>



<p>The main problem with plastic – besides its unwanted longevity – is size. Although they constitute a mere 7% of total waste, their volume takes up as much as 30% of landfill space as enormous heaps of unwanted toys, old items, and plastic packaging. Fortunately, we’re able to reprocess plastics into granulate for reuse. Once recycled, the popular plastic becomes material for infinite numbers of items which keeps it from unwanted circulation in the environment.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<br><strong>What plastic goes in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>PET bottles (remember to crush them)</li><li>milk and juice cartons (also crushed)</li><li>disposable shopping and foil bags (the less you use them the better!)</li><li>plastic cups and food packaging (no need to wash them, as long as they are empty)</li></ul>



<p><em>Caution! Plastics and metals go in the same yellow bin.</em></p>



<h4><br><strong>What plastics are not allowed in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>paint, varnish, oil packaging (including eg. vegetable oil)</li><li>old toys</li><li>old household articles or electronic devices</li><li>panels, pipes, and other construction waste</li><li>styrofoam</li><li>rubber (eg. car tires)</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled plastic?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>plastic bottles and packaging</li><li>garden furniture</li><li>toys</li><li>fibers for textile and carpet production</li></ul>



<h2>Food For Soil</h2>



<p>It would be ideal if we didn’t waste any food and so never threw it away. Well… even with perfect fridge management, there are still some peelings, skins, and leftovers of fruit and vegetables. Fortunately, once put in the biowaste bin, they will become valuable fertilizer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organic compost heaps are popular in the countryside. It’s easiest to have one for a detached house with a garden and the possibility of discarding biodegradable waste regularly. However, some urban neighborhoods also provide such a container. The fertilizer it produces is useful not only in the country. If there’s a bin for biowaste by your apartment building, here are a few tips.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="4120" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=4120" class="wp-image-4120" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Vegetable and fruit leftovers are valuable soil fertilizer!</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4><br><strong>What waste goes in the brown bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>fruit and vegetable leftovers</li><li>coffee and tea grounds</li><li>garden waste: leaves, branches, grass, flowers</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What waste is not allowed in the brown bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>non-green food leftovers</li><li>animal bones and feces</li><li>oil</li></ul>



<h4><strong>How can the organic fertilizer be used?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>as substrate for flower and vegetable beds</li><li>as fertilizer for lawns and greenbelts</li><li>for recultivating degraded and post-landfill areas</li><li>in parks and urban squares</li></ul>



<h2><strong>All the “Mixed” Lot</strong></h2>



<p>Now you know what to put in the recycling bins. And you know what, unfortunately, mustn’t go there and why. There is still a lot of rubbish that cannot be sorted (at least not directly by us). Most typically, all this lands in the largest black bin labeled “mixed waste”.</p>



<h4><br><strong>What else is allowed in the mixed waste bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>food leftovers</li><li>hygienic waste</li><li>ash</li></ul>



<p>Bulky, hazardous, or particularly sensitive waste cannot be disposed of into the black bin, but it must find its place. Electronic waste, used household articles, and other devices constitute a serious biohazard. Stored, they release toxic compounds, which make their way to the environment. Such waste should be given away during cyclical collections or brought directly to the Communal Waste Collection Points (GPZO). It’s the same for bulky waste, furniture, construction waste, expired medicines, and toxic substances. Find the addresses of GPZOs and details of their operation in Katowice<a href="http://odpady.katowice.eu/punkty-selektywnej-zbiorki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)"> here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No change happens overnight and on-demand. Both the cities and their residents need time to learn how to sort waste properly. However, there’s no doubt that it’s necessary and we all share this responsibility. Our grassroots work helps to manage the waste properly and therefore limit greenhouse gases emission, save water, energy, and natural resources. It’s as if we’re personally reaching out to our planet. How cool is that?</p>

<p><strong>Are you wondering what to do with your free weekend? Get moving! Katowice is a great base for exploring, it’s well-connected with other cities, not only in Poland but all over Europe. Let’s go on a trip!</strong></p>



<p>Katowice – the capital and the largest city in the Silesian Province. It’s also the main transportation center for the region and one of the biggest in Poland. You can easily reach it by plane, by car or by train. One of our favorites is the train, taking you directly (and smoothly) to visit not only the entire Silesia, but all of Poland, and a large piece of Europe as well. Once you’ve made yourself at home and started exploring the near and far corners of the region, you’ll have no problem finding many transport possibilities.</p>

<h2><strong>Get on the Right Train</strong></h2>



<p>Railway links to cities in Poland are offered by several companies. In our province, it’s Koleje Śląskie [Silesian Railways]. To Kraków (located in the Lesser Poland Province) you can go by the POLREGIO train, while the long-distance and international connections belong to PKP Intercity.<br>Don’t panic! You’ll find all of the connections at <a href="http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en">http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en</a> and it provides all the necessary information about the searched train ride. The service is also available in English, German, and Russian. <br>Are you ready to go?</p>



<p>It’s hard to miss the Katowice Railway Station, as it’s located right in the city center, near the marketplace. You can reach it from the Lecha i Marii Kaczyńskich Square (former Szewczyka Square), Kościuszki Street, and 3 Maja Street – directly or through the Galeria Katowicka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2012, a major renovation was completed. The main hall and ticket offices are open 24/7. What’s important: PKP Intercity and Koleje Śląskie have separate ticket offices. The travel information office is open from 7 am to 9 pm.</p>

<h2><strong>Discover the Silesian Province</strong></h2>



<p>Cities in our region are ideal destinations to visit on your day off. Check the timetable, buy a ticket, hop on the train, and in less than an hour you’re there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regional Koleje Śląskie railway company offers direct train connections on more than ten routes and the detailed map is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.kolejeslaskie.com/en/timetable/routes-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>The gems of our region are especially worth visiting on weekends and on holidays.

<p>The cities we recommend choosing for a visit first are the small, but charming <strong>Pszczyna,</strong> with its little marketplace, beautiful palace, and expansive park (30+ minutes) and <strong>Bielsko-Biała</strong>,<strong> </strong>where you can roam the picturesque streets of the old town (1 hour away).</p>



<p>Just as worth visiting are <strong>Gliwice</strong>, <strong>Tychy</strong>,<strong> Zabrze, </strong>and<strong> Bytom.</strong> The ride will take less than 30 minutes and you’ll find perfect places to visit on your trip regardless of the weather or season. Looking for foul weather attractions, be sure to check <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/places-around-katowice-to-visit-in-autumn-and-winter/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>What’s surely attractive about Silesia is how close it is to the mountains.&nbsp;You can get from Katowice city center to <strong>Ustroń</strong> in less than 2 hours by train, and 30 minutes later you can get off in <strong>Wisła</strong>. The city of <strong>Żywiec</strong> (especially tempting in the summer) is available by train in 90 minutes. Whether you’re a fan of winter sports or prefer summer hikes, the Beskidy Mountains have a lot to offer. You can find a few inspirations for this skiing season in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/ski-resorts-in-silesia/" target="_blank">this</a> post.</p>



<h2><strong>Go See Poland</strong></h2>



<p>Do you have a couple of days off or nothing to do this weekend? Those are perfect opportunities to go a bit further and visit some of the most popular Polish cities. Tickets for domestic train trips are available from the PKP Intercity ticket offices or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank">online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How about visiting beautiful <strong>Kraków</strong>? The POLREGIO train will take you to Kraków Główny [Kraków Central Station] in about 2 hours. It seems a lot for a mere 80 kilometers ride, but you can take a nap, read a book or even watch a movie. A one-way ticket costs 13 PLN.</p>

<p>Although the distance to <strong>Wrocław </strong>is 100 km longer, you’ll get there in less than 2,5 hours. A direct connection is offered by PKP Intercity and a 2nd class ticket costs about 33 PLN.</p>



<p>A trip to <strong>Warsaw</strong> – depending on the type of train you take – will take from over 2 up to almost 4 hours. The prices of tickets also vary. The fast Pendolino train booked 30 days in advance (as early as you can) costs 49 PLN. A ticket bought one day in advance will cost 140–150 PLN. If you can plan ahead, make sure you do. You’ll save time and money.</p>



<p>How about the seaside? In under 6 hours? You hop on the train after lunch on Friday and you arrive in <strong>Gdańsk</strong> for dinner. The entire weekend in Trójmiasto [Tri-Cities] is yours. It’s best to visit the Baltic Sea out of season and walk the nearly-empty beach in <strong>Gdynia</strong> Orłowo or enjoy the crowd-free <strong>Sopot</strong>. Booked in advance, a one-way 2nd class seat costs 132 PLN. Beautiful Gdańsk is surely worth the price and the trip.</p>



<h2><strong>See a Piece of Europe</strong></h2>



<p>Katowice is also a great starting point to take trips abroad. You can go directly to five European capitals (six, including Warsaw, as we mentioned before).</p>

<p>Let’s begin the European jaunt with <strong>Prague</strong>. You’ll reach the capital of the Czech Republic in under 6 hours. There are three fast links during the day: 8:17 am, 11:52 am and 4:18 pm. You can also depart from Katowice a few minutes past midnight. This train ride will take almost 8 hours, but if you can sleep on the train, you’ll find yourself in Prague in time for an early breakfast. A one-way ticket starts at 15€.<br>You can also get to Prague by Chech Leo Express trains. All useful information and railway link can be found <a href="https://www.leoexpress.com/en/where-we-go/line-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="on their website (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">on their website</a>. </p>



<p>Another capital totally worth visiting is <strong>Vienna</strong>. The number of connections a day: 4. Travel time: under 5 hours. Like Prague, fans of night travel can take the train from Katowice right after midnight. It takes a bit longer than a day ride (almost 7 hours), but it’s cheaper as well (from 9€ one way).</p>



<p>The distance from Katowice to <strong>Berlin</strong> is similar to going to the Polish seaside, but the train takes a little longer (7.5 hours). It goes at night and fortunately, only in sleepers. You need to turn up at Katowice Railway Station at 2:14 am sharp, to wake up at the Berlin Hauptbahnhof at 9:48 am. A one-way 2nd class ticket starts at 15€.</p>

<p>What about a trip to Slovakia? <strong>Bratislava</strong> isn’t as popular as other European destinations. It’s a shame – the city is worth a weekend visit, even more so because you can get there in about 5 hours. The fastest train leaves the Katowice station at 11:58 am and arrives in at Bratislava 4:50 pm.&nbsp;You can also choose the night connection. Price? From 19€ one way.</p>



<p><strong>Budapest</strong> in Hungary is the furthest European capital with a direct connection from Katowice, however, the train takes longer, 8,5 hours. It’s the same Intercity Chopin, which departs for Prague, Vienna, and Bratislava 7 minutes past midnight. The price, just like in the case of Prague, starts with a 19€ promotional price.</p>



<p>The timetable is available at the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank"> PKP Intercity</a> website. Tickets for international trains can only be bought in ticket offices at the station, but up to&nbsp;60 days in advance. In order to find the promotional prices given above, think of booking well in advance.

Regardless of whether you’re making your first runs on the slopes or if your skiing passion has been with you for years, it’s worth taking a closer look at the ski resorts in our region. We chose the 9 most interesting points on the Silesian winter sports map.</strong></p>

Novices are looking for equipment rentals and classes with an instructor, and experienced enthusiasts &#8211; facilities that meet their expectations. Experienced skiers and snowboarders have their favorite places in the Alps or in the Bethany Mountains (the Spanish Sierra Nevada is still gaining popularity). Yet, they’re also interested in Polish ski resorts. The resorts located in Silesia are exciting. Investment projects, numerous modernizations and expansions are a sign of considerable development in the area of ​​winter sports in our region. Just grab your winter gear and go!<br></p>



<h2>SZCZYRK</h2>



<h2>Beskid Sport Arena</h2>

This winter season, 2019/2020, the resort offers 4 ski runs with a total length of 3.2 km and an area of ​​8 ha. Particularly noteworthy is the flagship blue trail with a length of 1200 m. Its attraction is a 50-meter tunnel that allows for a collision-free passage under slalom slope No. 3.

<p>We’ll stay in Szczyrk, but we’ll move to the Szczyrk Mountain Resort, which is one of the largest ski resorts in Poland. This gem is located on the slopes of Małe Skrzyczne (1211 m a.s.l.) and Wierch Pośredni (1000 m a.s.l.) For years the resort has been considered an excellent destination for tourists from the Silesian and Lesser Poland provinces. It was also great option for skiing enthusiasts from the Czech Republic or Slovakia. The resort offers over 22 km of varied downhill runs (including 5 km of illuminated runs). Thanks to the cooperation with Centralny Ośrodek Sportu and Beskid Sport Arena, since the 2017 season you can use a joint ski pass covering up to 40 km of trails.</p>



<p>Currently, the Szczyrk Mountain Resort has completed the first stage of renovation. Thanks to this you can use the 10-seater gondola lift and two 6-seater chairlifts since the 2017 season. In the 2018 season another 6-seater chairlift for Zbójnicka Kopa was added, which is great for beginners. Last year the longest gondola ride in Szczyrk starts with a picturesque passage to Zbójnicka Kopa and the yellow walking trail. In the resort you’ll find the largest ski and snowboard school in Szczyrk, equipment rentals and ski schools covering up to 1000 m2 of a separate training zones, in which everyone, regardless of age, can make their first runs.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of talk about Istebna&#8217;s unique microclimate and if you believe them, there are good skiing conditions from November to April. And all thanks to the temperature, which in Istebna is usually a few degrees lower than in neighboring towns. At the Złoty Groń Ski Resort, you have very well prepared and extensive runs of varying difficulty. Here you’ll find a 6-person chairlift with a length of 800 m, the capacity of 2550 people / h and a speed of 5 m / s as well as a T-bar lift with a length of 290 m and a capacity of 900 people / h. </p>



<p>More advanced skiers can use the training route with electronic time measurement. The routes are illuminated and equipped with a modern snowmaking system. The resort also offers a ski school, a snowboard school, a rental shop, 4 food outlets, and free parking. The youngest winter sports enthusiasts can use the children&#8217;s area with a carousel and a ski lift.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have problems finding a perfect Christmas or Birthday gift for your loved ones? We’ve come to the rescue and present the most interesting local brands and shops to make your gifts unique and surprising to all this year.</strong></p>



<p>The avalanche of gift offers from shopping malls makes it difficult to fish out something of value. It is worthwhile, however, to look to local brands. Why? Because their handmade products come from passion, tradition, and hard work. Choosing them, you bet on quality, support local businesses, and ensure that your gift is original and unexpected. And Silesia is a true cradle of creativity!</p>



<h2>Nice Clothing</h2>



<p>Socks, hats, gloves, t-shirts – clothes and accessories are among the most popular gifts, especially for Christmas. How about, for a change, you present someone with <em>zoki</em> this year? Take it easy, they are still socks, but by the original “Gryfnie” brand.<br>The popularization of the Silesian dialect by the Gryfnie brand started with an online presence, but its most amusing words and slogans quickly found their way from the virtual world to t-shirts, hoodies, and gadgets. The young generation proudly wear their mycka [hat] and carry around their taszka na maszkety [tote bag]. Gryfnie has become recognizable all over Silesia and a gift featuring their logo is a must-have for anyone visiting Katowice.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something funny and truly Silesian, start your Christmas gift hunt with Gryfnie. You can also get posters, board games, ceramic pieces, cards – all harkening back to our dialect and tradition, but in fresh and modern version.</p>

<h2>Black Diamonds</h2>



<p>Marilyn Monroe sang that diamonds are a girl’s best friend. In Silesia, however, we have our own precious material – coal.<br> If you haven’t seen how elegant it can be, checkout such brands as “I Coal You” and “bro.KAT”. These Katowice ateliers create unique coal jewelry: rings, earrings, and necklaces in settings of precious metal, unique pendants, whose sophisticated form follows the natural shape of the coal nugget, and bracelets made of colorful strings.<br>This diverse range of products offers something for every lady.

<p>Choosing a gift, you can stick to a basic product, which is a bar of soap shaped like a traditional coal nugget, a beautifully cut diamond or a grenade. You can also choose a gift set available in various product and price configurations. Sadza Soap is a perfect alternative to popular cosmetic brands and yet more proof of how universal our good old coal can be.</p>

<h2>Traditional Ceramics</h2>



<p>Another gift-institution: the mug. In its Christmas edition, decorated with merry slogans and images, it’s one of the most popular presents.<br>We’re all for mugs, but… rather than another generic brand, why not try something traditional? Silesia’s Porcelana Bogucice [Bogucice Porcelain], dating back to the early 20th century, would be the perfect choice.<br><br>Looking for a ceramic gift, make your way to Fabryka Porcelany – there are several stores selling the Porcelana Bogucice brand. Elegant cups, teapots, and tableware – it is all worthy of your attention.</p>

<p>We suggest focussing on Kolekcja Śląska [the Silesian Collection], which are ceramic pieces featuring characters from our regional culture and folklore. A “Bebok” mug or a “Skarbnik” sugar bowl will be a perfect gift for a native Silesian, smiling at the memory of childhood legends, as well as for an outsider learning a small piece of our tradition.</p>

<h2>Silesia Sweets</h2>



<p>A bulletproof gift? Candy! Regardless of who the person is, chocolates and other sweets will always make them happy. And Silesians like to have something sweet, so you will be spoilt for choice.</p>



<p>Let’s start traditionally with Silesian <em>oblaty</em>. These thin sweet wafers used to be baked in Silesian homes and sold in the streets. Today, you can enjoy the traditional Śląskie Oblaty thanks to the Pszczyna-based manufacturer, Visa Bell, which offers various flavors – from the simple sweet classic flavor to cinnamon, vanilla, and walnut. They are an ideal gift and a Silesian souvenir all in one. Beside oblaty, the product line includes traditional comfits: aniseed kopalnioki, fruit-flavored <em>szkloki</em>, and mint <em>amoloki</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>To the enthusiasts of more sophisticated sweets, we recommend chocolates from Bielsko-Biała based Karmello. Belgian chocolate, quality ingredients, and a serious craftsmanship of handmade products have made Karmello so famous, that their sweets can be bought even in Japan and Scandinavia. Beautifully packed, in various flavor combinations and versions (Christmas specials included), they will be an ideal gift for any sweet tooth. If you happen upon a Karmello shop, don’t think twice.</p>

<p>And if you are not a fan of chocolate, we have something natural: urban honey! The bees from hives set up by the Pszczelarium foundation produce delicious honey on the roofs of Katowice buildings. A characteristic yellow label marks the jars of this sweet yet healthy and eco-friendly gift.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>November is a transitional time in Poland. The golden Polish autumn is over and there is still a little time left until white winter. Do you know how to spend an exciting time outside Katowice when the weather is terrible and foggy? The answer is in fascinating museums and attractions in Silesia. Below you will find six suggestions for those rainy days. From the centre of our metropolitan area you can reach them by car in 30-45 minutes.</strong></p>



<h2>The<strong> </strong>City Palm House in Gliwice [Palmiarnia]</h2>



<p>If you complain about the lack of greenery and warmth in autumn you must visit Gliwice. It’s the city where you can find one of the most impressive botanical facilities in southern Poland, if not in the whole country! The huge modern greenhouse is 2000 m2 in which over 5600 plant species grow, the oldest of which are even 150 years old! Discover giant palm trees, sun-loving flowers, tropical fruits like lemons, oranges, pomegranates, and avocado, plus tropical birds, turtles, lizards, chameleons, desert squirrels, and insects.

<h2>The Fire Museum &#8211; Żory</h2>



<p>If, after the Gliwice tropics, you still experience a lack of heat, we invite you to the city of Żory. There’s an unusual interactive museum dedicated to one of the five elements &#8211; fire. Why such an attraction right here? Well, during its several hundred years of existence, the city burned down dozens of times. To commemorate one of the most massive fires that took place in 1702, there’s even a Fire Festival celebrated here.</p>

<h2>The Museum of Silesian Uprisings &#8211; Świętochłowice</h2>



<p>Over the centuries Silesia was inhabited by Poles, Germans, and Czechs. The fluid borders in the region meant that for hundreds of years the influences and interests of all three nations mixed because of the changing borders and various times parts of Silesia belonged to different countries. The most significant border changes in the 20th century took place after the end of World War I, when the Silesian Uprisings took place in Silesia, i.e. three armed insurrections of Poles residing here against the German state (1919-1921). The insurgents at that time fought for Silesia to join the newly reborn&nbsp; Poland (1919).</p>

<h2>The Guido Mine and The Queen Louise Adit &#8211; Zabrze</h2>



<p>Silesia has long been associated with coal mining. In the past, almost every city in the region had one or even several coal mines.

These are attractions unique in a global scale that will allow you to feel the hardships of mining work and discover the historical heritage of this region.</p>

<p>The open-air museums are located at the original nineteenth-century mines. They are situated less than 2 kilometers from each other and give many reasons to visit. The main ones? A ride down in the mine shaft elevator over 300 meters underground. Venture among the over 200-year-old historical tunnels. Ride by boat on one of the longest underground tunnels in Europe (1100 meters). Travel on a suspended mine train, and if that isn’t enough &#8211; an exceptional beer can be enjoyed in the deepest pub on the continent!</p>

<h2>The Black Trout Adit and The Silver Museum &#8211; Tarnowskie Góry&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Zabrze isn’t the only city in Silesia where you can go underground and see what the work of miners looked like in the past. Equally interesting attractions, included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, are in Tarnowskie Góry. The 18th-century tunnels are a remnant of the &#8220;Fryderyk&#8221; mine, where silver ore was mined. In the Black Trout Adit, an underground boat ride awaits you on a 600-meter route connecting two mine shafts. In the Historic Silver Mine, a journey through the old tunnels from the 18th and 19th centuries can be enjoyed. During the 1.5 km route, we’ll get to know former jobs, tools, and work methods of the miners. The route is enriched with audiovisual effects that allow you to feel the real atmosphere of those times. The museum also has an exciting multimedia exhibition about the geology and history of these attractions, and is next to the Steam Engine Museum.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Princely Brewery &#8211; Tychy</h2>



<p>Although we’ve already offered you one beer during the tour, in the end, we invite you for one more. Tychy is a place that’s probably known to every adult Pole. It’s here that the headquarters of the company is located, which for many years created the brand that is synonymous with Polish beer &#8211; Tyskie. Tourists can visit both the historic brewery, which has been brewing beer for four centuries, and the unique museum with a collection of beer exhibits, mugs, mug coasters, and barrels from around the world. The crowning event of the visit is the tasting of their 14-day Tyskie Gronie in an historic pub. It’s worth considering using public transport. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong>The spring and summer period is a perfect time to get to know the greener side of Silesia and take a walk or go for a bike ride around one of the unique areas that our region abounds with. Today we would like to show you 6 interesting places around Katowice, which will enchant everyone with their unique natural beauty. Welcome to Pszczyna, Bytom, and Mikołów. You can reach all these places from Katowice in 30-60 minutes by public transport or by car. Well, unless you hop on your bike from the city center&#8230;</strong></p>



<h2>Cycling Route Katowice &#8211; Pszczyna: It’s Good to go Cycling in the Woods</h2>



<p>Although reaching a destination is vital, sometimes the road that leads to it is an attraction in itself. This will be the case if you hop on your two wheels and head south. Katowice is a city designed for cyclists, and the bike route to Pszczyna is a real classic. Importantly, the ride can start in the very center of Katowice, as the route starts in the Park Powstańców. This is where you’ll find the red markings of the trail that leads you directly to the village, called by some, the Pearl of Upper Silesia. </p>



<p>The route is about 50 kilometers long, but you don&#8217;t have to cycle without stopping. Moreover, it would be difficult considering the number of attractive stopovers that encourage you to take a break on your way. This bike path, for instance, goes through the recreational area of&nbsp; Trzy Stawy (“Three Ponds”), the reserve of &#8220;Kłodnica Springs&#8221;&nbsp; close to Lake Paprocany near Tychy and crosses the charming Kobiórskie forest. But, the biggest attractions are probably at the end of this fascinating route, which will be described further below.</p>

<h2>Palace Park in Pszczyna: A Walk with History in the Background</h2>



<p>Featured at the beginning, the Red Bicycle Trail from Katowice will also lead you to the walls of the historic palace in Pszczyna (but you can also reach this place driving or using public transport). Surrounded by greenery, this stately building has a long and beautiful history. Erected in the 11th or 12th century and repeatedly rebuilt, today it is regarded as a Neo-baroque gem. Now, this historic interior has been turned into a museum.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we’ll be more interested in its enchanting surroundings. Within this 156 hectare area,&nbsp;there is a beautiful park, arranged in the 2nd half of the 19th century in British style. It means that its appearance refers to the landscapes present in nature. For many years this complex has been enticing walkers with alleys interlacing picturesque lakes and cozy bridges thrown over lazily flowing rivers.</p>



<p>Located on the Islet in the Palace Park (Park Palacowy) the Daisy Tea Room has been attracting crowds of tourists recently. There you’ll find a rich selection of teas, lemonades, coffees, and delicious cakes and desserts. Strongly recommended after an intense walk or bike ride!</p>

<h2>Zagroda Żubrów (Bison Farm) in Pszczyna: King of the Forest in the City Center</h2>



<p>Pszczyna is a place recommended for a little longer stay. In addition to the interesting market square, it prides itself on the most powerful European mammal, the bison. Not so long ago these dignified animals were on the verge of extinction. Today you can meet them in a specially dedicated part of the park called the &#8220;Bison Farm&#8221;.</p>



<p>Nature lovers can preview the habits of these giant mammals using a convenient observation platform. You can also brush up on your knowledge of nature. There is a movie portraying this interesting animal, which can be watched in a small cinema room next door.</p>



<p>Although the bison is the real king of the park, it’s also accompanied by other animals, such as mouflons, deer, does, fallow deer, and several species of birds. It’s virtually a ZOO!</p>

<h2>Silesian Botanical Garden: Captivating Plants and an Extensive Panorama</h2>



<p>Fiołkowa Góra (Violet Mountain) is an inconspicuous hill located within the borders of Mikołów. Certainly, nobody would have heard of it if it hadn&#8217;t been for the so-called ‘natural inventory’ in 1996. It was demonstrated that the slopes of that relatively low hill and adjacent region with the two streams Promny and Jasienica were abundant with precious plant species. It was decided that good use should be made of those fallow lands taking into account their natural potential. Today Fiołkowa Góra is a bustling place. There’s the unique Silesian Botanical Garden, which is frequently visited by many, not only by Mikołów residents. </p>



<p>In numerous flower beds and squares grow various plants, eye-catching, and delighting us with their scents. Visitors can admire the exhibitions of nature photos whilst strolling around the area. A dense network of alleys, numerous benches, pleasant cafés, magnificent panoramas, and the observation tower (reaching as far as the Beskid mountains)&nbsp; &#8211; these attractions will definitely convince you to head for Mikołów on a nice and warm weekend.</p>

<h2>Segiet Reserve: UNESCO &#8211; A Primeval Forest</h2>



<p>Bytom is one of the oldest towns in Silesia, known for its long-standing mining traditions dating back to the Middle Ages. However, the city’s famous not only for its rich history but, also for the unique Silesian nature, whose extraordinary character was internationally recognized when this reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Reserve list. </p>



<p>If you want to see the original beech forest once growing in the region of Silesia, you must go to Segiet for a walk or a bike ride. Located in the area of abandoned mines, the reserve is located on the slopes of Srebrna Gora (347 m above sea level). Every nature lover will be enthralled with it. In the vicinity of the city, you’ll find enormous majestic beech trees 130-150 years old and rich fauna abundant with amphibians, reptiles, and birds. There’s a trail named &#8220;Las Segiecki&#8221; in the reserve,&nbsp; which facilitates moving around this extraordinary place.</p>

Enter Blachówka street, at the end of which there is a small car park. It is about 40 min from Katowice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Silesian Railways: head for Tarnowskie Góry (approx. 50 min, cost 4 PLN), then take&nbsp; 289 bus.

<h2>The Dolomites (Dolomity), Sports Valley (Sportowa Dolina) and Blachówka</h2>



<p>The commercial mining in the area of Bytom and Tarnowskie Góry can be specifically seen in the area of Blachówka quarry, adjacent to the nature reserve Segiet. When after many centuries of mining, commercial mining ended in 1990 and the land was eventually returned to nature. A several dozen &#8211; meter long slope of Triassic deposits and the interior of the valley (known to locals as ‘Great Canyon’ ),&nbsp;with trees and shrubs growing again, create an extraordinary atmosphere and make this place an attractive recreational area.</p>



<p>Today Blachówka is one of the most favorite places for walking and cycling, not only for Bytom residents but also for the inhabitants of&nbsp;all of Silesia. The mountain atmosphere in the heart of the Silesian metropolitan area is emphasized by the year-round sports facility built near the quarry-the Dolomites Sports Valley, where in winter you can go skiing and snowboarding. There is also a restaurant there with an interesting view of the valley, open all year round.</p>

<p>What exactly distinguishes this reservoir from others in the area? It’s how perfectly Paprocany’s nature harmonizes with modern architectural forms.

People seeking relaxation can sit back on somewhat futuristic benches with sunshades or lie in comfortable hammocks integrated into the structure of the promenade. The youngest will be happy to avail of the offer of Poland&#8217;s first water playground, and lovers of evening walks will feast their eyes on a multi-colored performance after dark by beautifully lit fountains.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>#2 Sosnowiec Wake Zone Stawiki: emotions on a wave</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of water activities, head towards Sosnowiec. The Wake Zone Stawiki park should be on the bucket list of people on a wave, who are looking for refreshment in summer. In 2013, a real Wake Park was opened in the water area near Stadion Ludowy. From that moment, the building was systematically retrofitted. Today, thrill seekers and enthusiasts of water attractions have at their fingertips a large wakeboard lift and a giant obstacle course created from inflatable forms floating on the water. Now, after a long and emotional struggle, visitors coming to Sosnowiec can finally sit in one of the gastronomic facilities&nbsp; to partake of the nutritious delicacies served there.</p>

<h2>#3 Dąbrowa Górnicza: Biała Przemsza gorge: a favorite place for canoeists</h2>



<p>Although it is not a typical highland river, it displays certain mountain river characteristics as it flows quite fast for a lowland stream. The Biała Przemsza river, which is quite an inconspicuous river flowing through towns such as Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, Mysłowice, and Jaworzno, used to share its riverbed with the Czarna Przemsza river and the Przemsza river, which together once marked the so-called Triangle of Three Emperors. We’re not going to elaborate on that, though, as this is a topic for history enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Today the Biała Przemsza appears mainly as a place created for leisure activity, for example canoeing! Enthusiasts of this sport can be found in different parts of the less than 64-kilometer-long watercourse, but the most popular is the gorge of the Biała Przemsza in Dąbrowa Górnicza -Kradzionów. At that point, the river is radically changing: it becomes wider and deeper, turns sharply and begins to meander. This sudden metamorphosis gives it charm and attracts paddling enthusiasts. If you are a canoeist, you will definitely be loving it!</p>



<p><strong>Rafting on the White Przemsza River</strong>: prices from 70 PLN<br><strong>Access:</strong> To Sławków, where most of the rafting starts, about a 30 minute drive by car from the center of Katowice. <br><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://przemsza.pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://przemsza.pl/ (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">https://przemsza.pl/</a><br></p>



<h2>#4 Pogoria: everyone gets&nbsp; active</h2>



<p>Bicycling, rollerblading, Nordic walking, kayaking, jet skiing, sail boating, and many other outdoor activities. Pogoria is a complex of four water reservoirs formed in Dąbrowa Górnicza in the abandoned sand pits where sand used to be extracted&nbsp; for the surrounding mines. It’s a real enclave of relaxation and a real green gem in the center of the metropolitan area. The ponds, which have a post-industrial origin, today form a protected landscape area and attract amateurs of outdoor activities from all over the region.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Croatia&#8221; is a place specially arranged for you to spend a pleasant time. The wooden footbridges, the pier, the gazebo, and the vantage points are pleasant places to relax. Furthermore, they make a stylish background for pictures. Thanks to the convenient cycling paths, the lakes have become a popular destination for cyclists, and the underwater world tempts diving fans.&nbsp; The local tourist infrastructure is new, but it’s not much older than&#8230; the lakes themselves. They were created completely by chance. The owners of the quarries did not pay their electric bills. When the electric company cut off the power, the pump ceased to work. It only took a few dozen hours for the quarries to turn into picturesque ponds.</p>



<p><strong>Free admission</strong><br><strong>Directions:</strong> Car approx. 30 min, Polish railways approx. 30 min. (Price from 5 zł),&nbsp; get off at Jaworzno Szczakowa station and  get on 314 bus , after 5 minutes get off at the stop at the Pieska Dive centre, and it takes just 15 minutes to get to the quarry on foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Environmental awareness in society is on the rise. We pay attention to the problems of food waste, lack of drinking water, and especially concerning recently, air pollution. The condition of our planet does make us anxious, but deep in our hearts we hope for solutions. However, there is no miracle cure and the changes can only be made step by step, as we all play our part.</strong></p>



<p>In June, “Forbes” named Katowice the most eco-friendly city in Poland, mainly in appreciation for its fight against smog. Surely, a good example should come from the top, which does not mean we can remain passive. Every action has a real influence on our reality. Let’s begin at home with changing our daily habits. How?&nbsp;You’ll find some tips in the first part of our eco-handbook. </p>



<h2>Save</h2>



<p>We’ve been told this since childhood – mainly with respect to money. Therefore, when we started earning our first “grown-up” money and could finally afford to make our first small dreams come true, the whole saving thing became much less appealing. However, we have slowly learned to understand it in a context wider than finances. It’s just as important to save what is scarce in nature or what affects our environment when produced – mainly water and electricity.<br>Water may be included in your rent, which does not have to mean doing your dishes with the water running. Just like with brushing your teeth and for you men, when shaving – simply turn the water off when possible. As the lucky owner of a bathtub, you don’t need to fill it to the brim to enjoy a lavish bath, have a tub will do. <br>Another thing is electricity. The small savings will not show instantly, but little by little does the trick. Turn the lights off when you leave a room. When you’re leaving home for the weekend unplug the chargers and make sure your devices are not on stand-by. Replace regular light bulbs with LED. Do the laundry when you actually have a full load. <br>Save paper – don’t print unnecessary invoices or e-mails and use both sides of your notebook pages. Use your smartphone ”Notes” and ”Calendar” – it’s usually at hand anyway, and all the files can be easily edited and shared with others. We aren’t saying stop buying books (which we love), but if your favorite newspaper comes in the e-version, use it. The life span of the printed one is as long as it takes for you to read it, plus a couple more days lying around the sofa after all.</p>



<h2>Drink Tap Water</h2>



<p>Over 2 billion people in the world have no access to drinking water. Sounds scary, doesn’t it? Statistics aside, we have our daily rituals. How about a big sip of tap water?<br>In Katowice, the quality of city water is good enough to drink safely. The city authorities and its KatoObywatel [KatoCitizen] initiative run the program #szluknijsiezkokotka [drink from the tap] and recommend it as cheaper and more eco. This initiative is increasingly being joined by Katowice pubs and restaurants, which serve tap water for free (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here you can find a list (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://katoobywatel.katowice.eu/nasze-akcje/kranowka-katowicka-szluknij-sie-z-kokotka/" target="_blank">here you can find a list</a>).<br>Drinking tap water is also directly connected with the issue of plastic overuse – drinking the recommended 2–3 liters of water, we throw away at least one plastic bottle a day, and this comes up to several hundred a year! Plus a six-pack of water makes for heavy lifting when it comes to replenishing the stock&#8230;<br>If you’re not sure about drinking straight from the tap, invest in a water filter pitcher. When leaving home, take a reusable bottle and refill it regularly. Every Friday and Saturday in the summer, hit the market square for a glass of refreshing “tap water” from the soda fountain sponsored by the city and the Katowice Water Department.<br>There’s also great news for the passengers at Pyrzowice airport – the A and B terminals have been recently equipped with watering stations where you can refill your water bottle. No more stress to find the expensive bottled water before departure. Finally!</p>

<h2>Plan Ahead</h2>



<p>According to the FAO (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), the world wastes ⅓ of its food a year. This amount is hard to imagine looking at a standard fridge. However, having opened it you do find things good for nothing but the trash. You bought something on sale, or because they came in cheaper multi-packs, or because the third one was almost free. Sounds familiar? It’s time to plan ahead! <br>A shopping list will make it easier to navigate the shop aisles. Instead of writing it down on a piece of paper, download one of the grocery shopping list apps like Listonic.<br>When faced with a “bargain”, ask yourself: Do I really need this? It will help you plan your shopping budget and not be surprised at the checkout. All this to the benefit of our planet and your wallet alike, reducing the risk of some of your shopping landing in the trash.</p>

<h2><strong>Buy Locally and Responsibly</strong></h2>



<p>Don’t go raspberry hunting in December and hold off your cravings for ripe tomatoes in February. Limit your consumption of what travels tens of thousands of kilometers before filling your shopping cart. The increasing demand for fashionable foods, especially “exotic” ones, leaves its mark on the environment. Have you heard about the forests being cut down so that oil palms can be planted? But, did you know about a similar situation concerning avocados? Mexico’s pine forests also being cut down so avocado trees can be planted.<br>Instead of marveling over the goji berry, go to your local market and see what is in season. In the center of Katowice, you can find several great market places, such as in Koszutka or at Plac Miarki. On Wednesday and Saturday take a large bag and visit the Biobazar in the former Huta Baildon [Baildon Steelworks]. You will be able to buy fruit and vegetables, dairy products, meat, and a plethora of other products from proven local suppliers. Interestingly, in Biobazar, your purchases will also be packed in your own containers.<br>The eco-friendy approach refers to cosmetics as well – they may be a bit more expensive, but you can be sure that they use only natural and eco-friendly ingredients. Whenever possible, choose small manufacturers that focus on the process as well as effects. An interesting and convenient solution – not only for travelers – are the multitask cosmetics, functioning as shower gel, shampoo, and soap for example. The “smart” bars are space-saving as well as cost-efficient. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>At Bio Bazar you can get local fruits and veggies, organic products, and even artisan cosmetics.</em></p>



<h2>Share</h2>



<p>Another piece of sound advice, which turns out to be tough to follow: whatever you use, use to the last drop, crumb, and piece. Quite a lot can be squeezed out of a seemingly empty tube of toothpaste or cream. Start with using the products you bought first, following the FIFO principle (First In, First Out). And if you know you will not be able to finish something and there is the risk that half of your mum’s Christmas stock will land in the trash, share it. All year long, food can be donated to your nearest soup kitchen and you can find the full list at<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://podzielmysie.pl/jadlodajnie-2/" target="_blank"> podzielmysie.pl</a>. Simply take the excess food to the given address. Over Christmas and Easter, there are special programs and a volunteer will pick the food up at your place. The dates and details are provided on their websites and Facebook. And if you are the one who wants to “hunt” for something in the no-waste spirit, use the Foodsi app, where restaurants offer left-over food from the day at half price. Also, in Katowice, Foodsi is being joined by the first eateries – download the app and catch the bargains!</p>



<p><strong>Old habits die hard. It takes engagement and changing your routines. Start with small, everyday practices, and see how quickly they become second nature. And sometimes, raise a refreshing glass of tap water to the health of our planet!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The city’s heart beats in various rhythms. Sometimes it is the most sought-after pop, rap or hip-hop, with which the capital of Upper Silesia is strongly connected. At other times it&#8217;s the best classics, jazz, electronic, and alternative or even heavier guitar sounds. Welcome to Katowice, the UNESCO City of Music, and discover the 7 most interesting music festivals worth attending.</strong></p>



<p>The music festival season in Katowice is in full bloom from early spring until late autumn. No wonder the city resounds with various trends and cultures, connecting generations of festival-goers.

<p>The beginnings of one of the most important and best-attended music festivals in Poland dates back to 2006. Tauron Nowa Muzyka Festival was created in the heart of Katowice at the initiative of a group of enthusiasts associated with Jazz Club Hipnoza. The premiere of the event brought an interesting line-up.  At the former site of the Wilson mine appeared, among others: DJ Krush, Swayzak, and Cristian Vogel.</p>



<p>The next two years the event took place in Cieszyn and then to permanently return to Katowice. The festival was first held at the closed Coal Mine &#8220;Katowice&#8221;, then it was organized in Dolina Trzech Stawów (Valley of Three Ponds), and eventually moved to the Strefa Kultury (Katowice Culture Zone). Futuristic sounds mingled perfectly with post-industrial locations of the subsequent concerts. During the 13 years of the Katowice festival, such electronic stars as Autechre, Prefuse 73, Jamie Lidell, Amon Tobin, Flying Lotus, Battles, Bonobo, Fever Ray, and many others performed. The next edition of the festival is drawing near!</p>

<h2>OFF Festival</h2>

<p>Today many fans of fresh alternative sounds cannot imagine a map of the most interesting music events without the OFF Festival. The originator, creator, and artistic director of this event is Artur Rojek &#8211; &nbsp;musician, once the frontman of the legendary band Myslovitz, today known for his solo projects in which he constantly searches for new sounds and means of expression. The first year of the OFF Festival took place in Park Słupna’s swimming area in Mysłowice, in Rojek’s hometown. Lech Janerka, Maria Peszek, Norwegian group The White Birch and reactivated Lenny Valentino &#8211; one of the originator&#8217;s musical projects &#8211; appeared on stage.</p>



<p>After four years, the festival was moved to Katowice, right in the heart of Dolina Trzech Stawów (Valley of Three Ponds). The change of venue also brought greater momentum to the initiative. Since then, music genres such as folk, noise, punk, indie pop, jazz, metal, and even rap have resounded on OFF Festivals. OFF earned the title of the most eclectic Polish festival, and the line-up with each subsequent year has delighted us more and more. Remarkable artists who have appeared on stage include: Iggy Pop, PJ Harvey, Patti Smith, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, The Flaming Lips, The National, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Slowdive, Belle And Sebastian, Run The Jewels, Charlotte Gainsbourg, MIA, Grizzly Bear and many more. There were also Polish favorites such as Hey, Apteka, Skalpel and Molesta, Pro- lament, Old River, Fury, and Zbigniew Wodecki with the Mitch &amp; Mitch group. No wonder that American &#8220;TIME&#8221; chose OFF Festival as one of the 14 most interesting festivals in the world.</p>

<p>Can you hear Irek Dudek singing out loud the name of the festival with his recognizable vocal tone? It would be difficult to react differently, because Rawa Blues Festival is an iconic event, and everybody knows the characteristic jingle from the television announcements. The initiative, which took its name from the Rawa River, today is one of the largest and oldest music festivals in Poland, as well as one of the most popular blues events in the world. Since the beginning of its existence, Rawa Blues Festival has been faithful to Katowice and Hala Spodek, as concerts have been held there consistently since 1981. Blues fans come from all over the globe and treat the event as one of the biggest blues music festivals.</p>

<p>Irek Dudek, a bluesman, composer, vocalist, songwriter, and one of the most colorful birds on the Polish music scene, has been the creator and organizer of the festival for many years. For the first 10 years, the festival was organized as all-day blues sessions. Over time it has evolved becoming an international blues festival. Since then real legends have appeared on the scene of Spodek, including Robert Cray, Keb &#8216;Mo&#8217;, JJ Gray &amp; Mofro, Elvin Bishop, Otis Taylor, Marcia Ball, Luther Allison, Junior Wells, Koko Taylor, Rod Piazza &amp; The Mighty Flyers, Marcia Ball and Big Bill Morganfield. In 2012 the largest international blues association, The Blues Foundation, awarded Rawa Blues with the Keeping The Blues Alive award in the International Festival category. Rawa is a “must go to” for blues fans and those who want to attend a top-notch event. Tune in this fall!</p>

<p>If we were to point out a festival that year-on-year enjoys the unflagging interest of fans, with tickets selling like hotcakes, it will undoubtedly be the Męskie Granie festival. It&#8217;s been 9 years since the first event was initiated and originated by Zywiec. This is a unique festival on the map of musical events, all thanks to its formula. Only Polish artists appear on stage at Męskie Granie. As the organizers emphasize, the goal of the initiative is to present the creative side of the Polish music scene and to encourage listeners to musical experiments. Despite the name, not only charismatic musicians and vocalists can be seen on the festival stages (including Wojciech Waglewski, Ørganek, Dawid Podsiadło, Krzysztof Zalewski, O.S.T.R. or Tomek Lipiński), but also intriguing artists such as Katarzyna Nosowska, Natalia Przybysz, Krystyna Prońko or Mela Koteluk. </p>

<p>In 2014, as part of the event, a group of artists called the Męskie Granie Orchestra was also created. Its composition is different every year, and the repertoire includes both new songs and legendary ones in completely new arrangements. There is a great deal of excitement about the new annual single promoting the Meskie Granie tour. The song usually has its premiere on Trójka radio (Program Trzeci Polskiego Radia), a few weeks before the tour begins. For years Piotr Stelmach &#8211; a festival announcer and music journalist  &#8211; has announced the single. A few months after each completed tour a music album is released with a record of the most interesting performances from the edition.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s novelty on the Silesian festival scene has a chance to become the real hit of the season. The event has gained considerable momentum and interest from festival people since the very beginning. Organized in ​​the vast Park Śląski (Silesian Park in Chorzów), the Fest Festival, before it even started, had already been dubbed one of the most interesting outdoor events to take place this year in the country. As the organizers write &#8220;Our goal is to show that a music festival is more than just stages and artists. This is the time when we are moving to another world and we are running away from our daily activities, to enjoy the moment and to be with fantastic people.&#8221; In the two-day line-up of the festival, you can find names known from various musical trends. Particularly noteworthy are such artists as Róisín Murphy known from Moloko and solo projects, Metronomy, Little Dragon or the New York Lion Babe duo. Rap fans will certainly appreciate the presence of Wu-Tang Clan, Sokół, Bedoes, and Otsochodzi. For lovers of electronic sounds, the organizers have prepared a headliner in the form of Disclosure duo. The new point on the festival map may turn out to be a hit, which will encourage music fans to explore Katowice&#8217;s vibrant music genres.</p>



<ul><li><strong>When and where is the first event?</strong> 23-24 August 2019 / Park Śląski w Chorzów</li><li><strong>Who will perform? </strong>Jaden Smith, Alan Walker, Wu-Tang Clan, Disclosure, Metronomy, Lion Babe, Sevdaliza, Rejjie Snow and others.</li><li><strong>WWW:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.festfestival.pl/en" target="_blank">https://www.festfestival.pl/en</a></li></ul>

<p>The last two positions in our ranking are festivals that have already come and gone this year, and the organizers are already working on the future ones. These are festivals that add a sound variety to the Katowice map of musical events. The festival heart of Katowice resounds not only with alternative music and popular music. Every spring, since 2015, in the modern NOSPR halls the unique Katowice Kultura Natura Festival has been held. It is a cyclical, usually a few days long, musical feast, which combines the most beautiful sounds with reflections on a chosen topic. In previous years, the motifs of musical travel were: Metamorfoza/Metamorphosis (2015), Duchowość/Spirituality (2016), Ziemia/Earth (2017) and Dziecięctwo/Childhood (2018). The theme of this year&#8217;s fifth during the festival was <em>the Woman. Divine femininity, feminine divinity &#8211; from metaphysics to music</em>. </p>



<p>The organizers of the festival are the National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Katowice and the Kultura Natura Association. The festival also has two excellent initiators. The first of them is Alexander Liebreich &#8211; artistic director of the event and the first conductor of NOSPR. The second is professor Eugeniusz Knapik &#8211; Dean of the Music Academy in Katowice in 2002-2008, currently holding the position of president of the Kultura Natura Association. As part of this year&#8217;s festival, distinguished conductors and artists appeared on stage, including the aforementioned Alexander Liebreich with NOSPR musicians, Nikolai Lugansky, Youn Sun Nah Trio, and Jerusalem Quartet.</p>

<p>Although Katowice Jazz Art Festival is a relatively young event (premiering in 2014), it quickly won both the hearts of jazz enthusiasts and all those interested in the new initiative. Musical meetings with jazz are organized in many different places in Katowice, which are closely related to culture: NOSPR, Rondo Sztuki, Muzeum Śląskie, Kinoteatr Rialto, IMP Institute of Music Performance, Katowice Miasto Ogrodów or Pałac Młodzieży. Interestingly enough, on the festival map there are also jazz-filled, intimate clubs such as Jazz Club Hipnoza, Winkel Club, Absurdalna, and Drzwi Zwane Koniem (Doors Called a Horse). Every year in the spring Katowice blooms with jazz sounds and the list of artists from all over the world is impressive. </p>

<p>Each edition of the festival is accompanied by a motto associated with a chosen, often legendary figure from the world of jazz music. This year&#8217;s event was accompanied by the words of Miles Davies &#8220;You should never be comfortable, man.&#8221; As the authors emphasize, the latest Katowice Jazz Art Festival gained a moon-related name: oneiric, dreamy but still bursting with creative energy. The organizers of the event this year opted for intimate venues where musical meetings become more intimate, and the viewers are in closer contact with the artists. Getting out of the comfort zone, as Davies said, this year the musicians started from themselves.</p>
