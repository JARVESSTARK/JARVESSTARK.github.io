<p><strong>Sorting your waste is not only good practice, but an obligation. Unfortunately, there’s often doubt which bin to choose. How do you recycle according to the regulations and how does it serve our planet? Here are some explanations and tips.</strong><br></p>



<p>Hats off to those who limit their daily waste production. Whether we call this the less waste trend, eco-awareness or internal need, each of us should reduce waste to the minimum. Let’s face it though – less doesn’t mean none. It’s rather impossible not to produce any garbage in our daily life. Sooner or later, some of our shopping and everyday activities will result in filling the bin. And it should be the right one. </p>



<h2>Why Recycle?</h2>



<p>Do you know how much communal waste was produced last year by an average resident of Poland? 315 kg! This means nearly 1 kg of rubbish every day. What is equally disturbing is the fact that only 37% of that was recycled. It’s far from enough as 80% of our rubbish can be reused.</p>



<p>Environmental issues aside, from the economic perspective, recycling means considerable savings – not just globally, but also individually. Since January 1st 2020, all Polish cities are obliged to recycle 50% of communal waste. Simply put – half of the garbage that lands in our bins should be recycled. As people are easily motivated by awards (and, less fortunately, punishment), since 2020 the non-recycled waste costs us a pretty penny. And so in Katowice the charge per each person in a recycling household is 21.30 a month, while in the non-recycling ones – twice as much.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the cost of non-recycling is also born by our environment. The spreading landfills, greenhouse gas emission, soil and water contamination, fire hazard – are but a few of the considerable threats initiated by each of us.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Recycle?</strong></h2>



<p>The simplest answer is: do something, regularly and consistently, starting at home. Whether it’s a small apartment downtown or a large country house, the obligation to recycle applies to everybody. A small kitchen is no excuse, as a wide range of recycling bins of various shapes and sizes are on offer in any hardware store and online. For recycling, you can also use paper bags and cardboard boxes, or simply put all recyclables in one place and sort them directly into proper bins. Done regularly, it surely won’t garbage-swamp your apartment?</p>

<p>The important thing is to sort the waste into glass (green bin), paper (blue), metal + plastics (yellow), mixed (black) and bio (brown). It’s not always obvious which bin to choose. Sometimes, the color doesn’t match the use, but the bin is still marked in another way. No excuses, the ball is in our court. Let the sorting begin!</p>



<h2><strong>Not All That Shatters Is Glass</strong></h2>



<p>Glass recycling is one of the most economically and ecologically beneficial recycling processes. Its products maintain all the original properties and quality. Additionally, the cullet used for manufacturing new items melts at a lower temperature than the raw materials in the initial production. Recycling glass saves energy, water, and natural resources (including quartz sand).</p>



<p>What’s important, not every item that shatters and is commonly considered glass can be recast. Various melting temperatures and compositions make some glass non-recyclable: window glass, light bulbs, also drinking glasses.</p>

<h4><br><strong>What glass goes in the green bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>glass bottles – clear and color (yes, wine bottles also;))</li><li>food jars (without metal lids)</li><li>glass cosmetics containers</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What is not allowed in the green bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>drinking glasses</li><li>tableware</li><li>window glass and mirrors</li><li>bulbs</li><li>grave candles</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled glass?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>glass containers</li><li>optical glass</li><li>construction materials</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Paper Fight For Trees</strong></h2>



<p>It’s estimated that the world produces 10 tons of paper per second. Despite the increasing popularity of the on-line issues of our favorite magazines and books, as well as numerous campaigns against unnecessary printing of documents, paper use in Poland is almost twice the world average.</p>



<p>The good news is that paper can be recycled up to 4 times. The recycled material won’t be as smooth and snow-white as the first grade, because the cellulose fibers gradually decrease in quality. However, grey paper or cardboard do have a range of applications, while recycling 1 ton of paper helps save 17 trees, that is&nbsp; 1 acre of forest (that’s how much it takes to produce 1 ton of paper).</p>



<p>In order to sort paper properly, you need to pay attention to the daily rubbish that is usually thoughtlessly tossed into the bin. The blue recycling bin shouldn’t contain tissues or paper towels, nor shopping receipts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="4105" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=4105" class="wp-image-4105" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/papierowe-torby-eko-1.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Paper shopping bags are an eco-friendly choice.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4><br><strong>What paper goes in the blue bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>newspapers and magazines</li><li>office paper: printed paper, brochures, leaflets, envelopes</li><li>books (which we suggest you give away rather than bin;))</li><li>unsoiled cardboard packaging</li><li>cardboard</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What is not allowed in the blue bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>used tissues and paper towels</li><li>shopping receipts</li><li>soiled and greasy cardboard packaging (like a pizza box)</li><li>milk or juice cartons</li><li>coated paper</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled paper?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>egg boxes</li><li>coffee filters</li><li>toilet paper and disposable towels</li><li>office paper</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Metal Saves Energy</strong></h2>



<p>Metal is perfect for recycling. The most popular recyclables are steel and aluminium as they maintain their properties despite numerous reprocessing cycles. This is especially important in aluminium production which uses a non-renewable element – bauxite.</p>



<p>Metal recycling is not only a pro-ecological procedure, but also a business necessity. It responds to market demand, limiting the production costs, and saving the natural metal deposits. Do you know that 75% of aluminium manufactured to date remains in circulation worldwide? Disposing proper waste into the yellow bin you contribute to these statistics.</p>



<h4><br><strong>What metals go in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>metal bottle caps and lids</li><li>food tins</li><li>aluminium soda cans&nbsp;</li><li>aluminium foil</li></ul>



<p><em>Remember that metal and plastics go in the same yellow bin!</em></p>



<h4><br><strong>What is not allowed in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>paint and oil cans</li><li>large-size scrap metal and wires</li><li>used batteries</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled metal?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>car parts</li><li>aluminium cans and containers</li><li>pipes</li><li>metal kitchenware</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Plastic Deluge</strong></h2>



<p>Plastic is the plague of our times. Still, you must admit, they make our daily life easier and are hard to give up. Let’s use them, but in moderation, knowing that once produced, plastic will remain on earth for many generations. That’s how long it takes for a plastic bottle or a regular (and, unfortunately, also disposable) plastic bag to decompose.</p>



<p>The main problem with plastic – besides its unwanted longevity – is size. Although they constitute a mere 7% of total waste, their volume takes up as much as 30% of landfill space as enormous heaps of unwanted toys, old items, and plastic packaging. Fortunately, we’re able to reprocess plastics into granulate for reuse. Once recycled, the popular plastic becomes material for infinite numbers of items which keeps it from unwanted circulation in the environment.</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<br><strong>What plastic goes in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>PET bottles (remember to crush them)</li><li>milk and juice cartons (also crushed)</li><li>disposable shopping and foil bags (the less you use them the better!)</li><li>plastic cups and food packaging (no need to wash them, as long as they are empty)</li></ul>



<p><em>Caution! Plastics and metals go in the same yellow bin.</em></p>



<h4><br><strong>What plastics are not allowed in the yellow bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>paint, varnish, oil packaging (including eg. vegetable oil)</li><li>old toys</li><li>old household articles or electronic devices</li><li>panels, pipes, and other construction waste</li><li>styrofoam</li><li>rubber (eg. car tires)</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What can be produced from recycled plastic?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>plastic bottles and packaging</li><li>garden furniture</li><li>toys</li><li>fibers for textile and carpet production</li></ul>



<h2>Food For Soil</h2>



<p>It would be ideal if we didn’t waste any food and so never threw it away. Well… even with perfect fridge management, there are still some peelings, skins, and leftovers of fruit and vegetables. Fortunately, once put in the biowaste bin, they will become valuable fertilizer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organic compost heaps are popular in the countryside. It’s easiest to have one for a detached house with a garden and the possibility of discarding biodegradable waste regularly. However, some urban neighborhoods also provide such a container. The fertilizer it produces is useful not only in the country. If there’s a bin for biowaste by your apartment building, here are a few tips.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="4120" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=4120" class="wp-image-4120" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fruits-and-vegetables-in-kitchen-1.jpg 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Vegetable and fruit leftovers are valuable soil fertilizer!</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4><br><strong>What waste goes in the brown bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>fruit and vegetable leftovers</li><li>coffee and tea grounds</li><li>garden waste: leaves, branches, grass, flowers</li></ul>



<h4><strong>What waste is not allowed in the brown bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>non-green food leftovers</li><li>animal bones and feces</li><li>oil</li></ul>



<h4><strong>How can the organic fertilizer be used?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>as substrate for flower and vegetable beds</li><li>as fertilizer for lawns and greenbelts</li><li>for recultivating degraded and post-landfill areas</li><li>in parks and urban squares</li></ul>



<h2><strong>All the “Mixed” Lot</strong></h2>



<p>Now you know what to put in the recycling bins. And you know what, unfortunately, mustn’t go there and why. There is still a lot of rubbish that cannot be sorted (at least not directly by us). Most typically, all this lands in the largest black bin labeled “mixed waste”.</p>



<h4><br><strong>What else is allowed in the mixed waste bin?</strong></h4>



<ul><li>food leftovers</li><li>hygienic waste</li><li>ash</li></ul>



<p>Bulky, hazardous, or particularly sensitive waste cannot be disposed of into the black bin, but it must find its place. Electronic waste, used household articles, and other devices constitute a serious biohazard. Stored, they release toxic compounds, which make their way to the environment. Such waste should be given away during cyclical collections or brought directly to the Communal Waste Collection Points (GPZO). It’s the same for bulky waste, furniture, construction waste, expired medicines, and toxic substances. Find the addresses of GPZOs and details of their operation in Katowice<a href="http://odpady.katowice.eu/punkty-selektywnej-zbiorki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)"> here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No change happens overnight and on-demand. Both the cities and their residents need time to learn how to sort waste properly. However, there’s no doubt that it’s necessary and we all share this responsibility. Our grassroots work helps to manage the waste properly and therefore limit greenhouse gases emission, save water, energy, and natural resources. It’s as if we’re personally reaching out to our planet. How cool is that?</p>

<p><strong>Are you wondering what to do with your free weekend? Get moving! Katowice is a great base for exploring, it’s well-connected with other cities, not only in Poland but all over Europe. Let’s go on a trip!</strong></p>



<p>Katowice – the capital and the largest city in the Silesian Province. It’s also the main transportation center for the region and one of the biggest in Poland. You can easily reach it by plane, by car or by train. One of our favorites is the train, taking you directly (and smoothly) to visit not only the entire Silesia, but all of Poland, and a large piece of Europe as well. Once you’ve made yourself at home and started exploring the near and far corners of the region, you’ll have no problem finding many transport possibilities.</p>

<h2><strong>Get on the Right Train</strong></h2>



<p>Railway links to cities in Poland are offered by several companies. In our province, it’s Koleje Śląskie [Silesian Railways]. To Kraków (located in the Lesser Poland Province) you can go by the POLREGIO train, while the long-distance and international connections belong to PKP Intercity.<br>Don’t panic! You’ll find all of the connections at <a href="http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en">http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en</a> and it provides all the necessary information about the searched train ride. The service is also available in English, German, and Russian. <br>Are you ready to go?</p>



<p>It’s hard to miss the Katowice Railway Station, as it’s located right in the city center, near the marketplace. You can reach it from the Lecha i Marii Kaczyńskich Square (former Szewczyka Square), Kościuszki Street, and 3 Maja Street – directly or through the Galeria Katowicka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2012, a major renovation was completed. The main hall and ticket offices are open 24/7. What’s important: PKP Intercity and Koleje Śląskie have separate ticket offices. The travel information office is open from 7 am to 9 pm.</p>

<h2><strong>Discover the Silesian Province</strong></h2>



<p>Cities in our region are ideal destinations to visit on your day off. Check the timetable, buy a ticket, hop on the train, and in less than an hour you’re there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regional Koleje Śląskie railway company offers direct train connections on more than ten routes and the detailed map is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.kolejeslaskie.com/en/timetable/routes-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>The gems of our region are especially worth visiting on weekends and on holidays.

<p>The cities we recommend choosing for a visit first are the small, but charming <strong>Pszczyna,</strong> with its little marketplace, beautiful palace, and expansive park (30+ minutes) and <strong>Bielsko-Biała</strong>,<strong> </strong>where you can roam the picturesque streets of the old town (1 hour away).</p>



<p>Just as worth visiting are <strong>Gliwice</strong>, <strong>Tychy</strong>,<strong> Zabrze, </strong>and<strong> Bytom.</strong> The ride will take less than 30 minutes and you’ll find perfect places to visit on your trip regardless of the weather or season. Looking for foul weather attractions, be sure to check <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/places-around-katowice-to-visit-in-autumn-and-winter/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>What’s surely attractive about Silesia is how close it is to the mountains.&nbsp;You can get from Katowice city center to <strong>Ustroń</strong> in less than 2 hours by train, and 30 minutes later you can get off in <strong>Wisła</strong>. The city of <strong>Żywiec</strong> (especially tempting in the summer) is available by train in 90 minutes. Whether you’re a fan of winter sports or prefer summer hikes, the Beskidy Mountains have a lot to offer. You can find a few inspirations for this skiing season in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/ski-resorts-in-silesia/" target="_blank">this</a> post.</p>



<h2><strong>Go See Poland</strong></h2>



<p>Do you have a couple of days off or nothing to do this weekend? Those are perfect opportunities to go a bit further and visit some of the most popular Polish cities. Tickets for domestic train trips are available from the PKP Intercity ticket offices or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank">online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How about visiting beautiful <strong>Kraków</strong>? The POLREGIO train will take you to Kraków Główny [Kraków Central Station] in about 2 hours. It seems a lot for a mere 80 kilometers ride, but you can take a nap, read a book or even watch a movie. A one-way ticket costs 13 PLN.</p>

<p>Although the distance to <strong>Wrocław </strong>is 100 km longer, you’ll get there in less than 2,5 hours. A direct connection is offered by PKP Intercity and a 2nd class ticket costs about 33 PLN.</p>



<p>A trip to <strong>Warsaw</strong> – depending on the type of train you take – will take from over 2 up to almost 4 hours. The prices of tickets also vary. The fast Pendolino train booked 30 days in advance (as early as you can) costs 49 PLN. A ticket bought one day in advance will cost 140–150 PLN. If you can plan ahead, make sure you do. You’ll save time and money.</p>



<p>How about the seaside? In under 6 hours? You hop on the train after lunch on Friday and you arrive in <strong>Gdańsk</strong> for dinner. The entire weekend in Trójmiasto [Tri-Cities] is yours. It’s best to visit the Baltic Sea out of season and walk the nearly-empty beach in <strong>Gdynia</strong> Orłowo or enjoy the crowd-free <strong>Sopot</strong>. Booked in advance, a one-way 2nd class seat costs 132 PLN. Beautiful Gdańsk is surely worth the price and the trip.</p>



<h2><strong>See a Piece of Europe</strong></h2>



<p>Katowice is also a great starting point to take trips abroad. You can go directly to five European capitals (six, including Warsaw, as we mentioned before).</p>

<p>Let’s begin the European jaunt with <strong>Prague</strong>. You’ll reach the capital of the Czech Republic in under 6 hours. There are three fast links during the day: 8:17 am, 11:52 am and 4:18 pm. You can also depart from Katowice a few minutes past midnight. This train ride will take almost 8 hours, but if you can sleep on the train, you’ll find yourself in Prague in time for an early breakfast. A one-way ticket starts at 15€.<br>You can also get to Prague by Chech Leo Express trains. All useful information and railway link can be found <a href="https://www.leoexpress.com/en/where-we-go/line-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="on their website (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">on their website</a>. </p>



<p>Another capital totally worth visiting is <strong>Vienna</strong>. The number of connections a day: 4. Travel time: under 5 hours. Like Prague, fans of night travel can take the train from Katowice right after midnight. It takes a bit longer than a day ride (almost 7 hours), but it’s cheaper as well (from 9€ one way).</p>



<p>The distance from Katowice to <strong>Berlin</strong> is similar to going to the Polish seaside, but the train takes a little longer (7.5 hours). It goes at night and fortunately, only in sleepers. You need to turn up at Katowice Railway Station at 2:14 am sharp, to wake up at the Berlin Hauptbahnhof at 9:48 am. A one-way 2nd class ticket starts at 15€.</p>

<p>What about a trip to Slovakia? <strong>Bratislava</strong> isn’t as popular as other European destinations. It’s a shame – the city is worth a weekend visit, even more so because you can get there in about 5 hours. The fastest train leaves the Katowice station at 11:58 am and arrives in at Bratislava 4:50 pm.&nbsp;You can also choose the night connection. Price? From 19€ one way.</p>



<p><strong>Budapest</strong> in Hungary is the furthest European capital with a direct connection from Katowice, however, the train takes longer, 8,5 hours. It’s the same Intercity Chopin, which departs for Prague, Vienna, and Bratislava 7 minutes past midnight. The price, just like in the case of Prague, starts with a 19€ promotional price.</p>



<p>The timetable is available at the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank"> PKP Intercity</a> website. Tickets for international trains can only be bought in ticket offices at the station, but up to&nbsp;60 days in advance. In order to find the promotional prices given above, think of booking well in advance.

<p><strong>Do you have problems finding a perfect Christmas or Birthday gift for your loved ones? We’ve come to the rescue and present the most interesting local brands and shops to make your gifts unique and surprising to all this year.</strong></p>



<p>The avalanche of gift offers from shopping malls makes it difficult to fish out something of value. It is worthwhile, however, to look to local brands. Why? Because their handmade products come from passion, tradition, and hard work. Choosing them, you bet on quality, support local businesses, and ensure that your gift is original and unexpected. And Silesia is a true cradle of creativity!</p>



<h2>Nice Clothing</h2>



<p>Socks, hats, gloves, t-shirts – clothes and accessories are among the most popular gifts, especially for Christmas. How about, for a change, you present someone with <em>zoki</em> this year? Take it easy, they are still socks, but by the original “Gryfnie” brand.<br>The popularization of the Silesian dialect by the Gryfnie brand started with an online presence, but its most amusing words and slogans quickly found their way from the virtual world to t-shirts, hoodies, and gadgets. The young generation proudly wear their mycka [hat] and carry around their taszka na maszkety [tote bag]. Gryfnie has become recognizable all over Silesia and a gift featuring their logo is a must-have for anyone visiting Katowice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" data-id="3056" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3056" class="wp-image-3056" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Śląskie-marki-Gryfnie-bluzy-1-1.jpg 1910w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for something funny and truly Silesian, start your Christmas gift hunt with Gryfnie. You can also get posters, board games, ceramic pieces, cards – all harkening back to our dialect and tradition, but in fresh and modern version.</p>

Also, a gentleman’s wardrobe will benefit from elegant accessories like cufflinks or a tiepin. If the person you have in mind appreciates unique handmade objects, make sure to check out the offers from the coal ateliers.</p>

<p>With the passing of every season, the Poszetka atelier line is expended with other elements of men’s clothing, including shirts and suits. It is all made from the best fabrics, with the utmost care for every little detail.<br>Visiting their beautiful studio and leafing through the collection of colorful silk handkerchiefs to find a perfect gift is a pleasure in itself.</p>

<p>Choosing a gift, you can stick to a basic product, which is a bar of soap shaped like a traditional coal nugget, a beautifully cut diamond or a grenade. You can also choose a gift set available in various product and price configurations. Sadza Soap is a perfect alternative to popular cosmetic brands and yet more proof of how universal our good old coal can be.</p>

<h2>Traditional Ceramics</h2>



<p>Another gift-institution: the mug. In its Christmas edition, decorated with merry slogans and images, it’s one of the most popular presents.<br>We’re all for mugs, but… rather than another generic brand, why not try something traditional? Silesia’s Porcelana Bogucice [Bogucice Porcelain], dating back to the early 20th century, would be the perfect choice.<br><br>Looking for a ceramic gift, make your way to Fabryka Porcelany – there are several stores selling the Porcelana Bogucice brand. Elegant cups, teapots, and tableware – it is all worthy of your attention.</p>

<p>We suggest focussing on Kolekcja Śląska [the Silesian Collection], which are ceramic pieces featuring characters from our regional culture and folklore. A “Bebok” mug or a “Skarbnik” sugar bowl will be a perfect gift for a native Silesian, smiling at the memory of childhood legends, as well as for an outsider learning a small piece of our tradition.</p>

<h2>Silesia Sweets</h2>



<p>A bulletproof gift? Candy! Regardless of who the person is, chocolates and other sweets will always make them happy. And Silesians like to have something sweet, so you will be spoilt for choice.</p>



<p>Let’s start traditionally with Silesian <em>oblaty</em>. These thin sweet wafers used to be baked in Silesian homes and sold in the streets. Today, you can enjoy the traditional Śląskie Oblaty thanks to the Pszczyna-based manufacturer, Visa Bell, which offers various flavors – from the simple sweet classic flavor to cinnamon, vanilla, and walnut. They are an ideal gift and a Silesian souvenir all in one. Beside oblaty, the product line includes traditional comfits: aniseed kopalnioki, fruit-flavored <em>szkloki</em>, and mint <em>amoloki</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>To the enthusiasts of more sophisticated sweets, we recommend chocolates from Bielsko-Biała based Karmello. Belgian chocolate, quality ingredients, and a serious craftsmanship of handmade products have made Karmello so famous, that their sweets can be bought even in Japan and Scandinavia. Beautifully packed, in various flavor combinations and versions (Christmas specials included), they will be an ideal gift for any sweet tooth. If you happen upon a Karmello shop, don’t think twice.</p>

<p>And if you are not a fan of chocolate, we have something natural: urban honey! The bees from hives set up by the Pszczelarium foundation produce delicious honey on the roofs of Katowice buildings. A characteristic yellow label marks the jars of this sweet yet healthy and eco-friendly gift.</p>

<h2>The Fire Museum &#8211; Żory</h2>



<p>If, after the Gliwice tropics, you still experience a lack of heat, we invite you to the city of Żory. There’s an unusual interactive museum dedicated to one of the five elements &#8211; fire. Why such an attraction right here? Well, during its several hundred years of existence, the city burned down dozens of times. To commemorate one of the most massive fires that took place in 1702, there’s even a Fire Festival celebrated here.</p>

<p>The unusual museum, with its very structure, which is reminiscent of fire flames, attracts the attention of visitors. It’s even more impressive inside and the exhibitions present the place of fire in human culture and history, physical and chemical experiments, and ways to fight fires. The Żory museum is far from traditional sightseeing and virtual exhibitions will interest both young and old alike.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hours:</strong> Tue &#8211; Fri: 09 am &#8211; 4 pm, Sat &#8211; Sun: 10 am &#8211; 5 pm, Monday closed.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> regular ticket 16 PLN, reduced ticket 12 PLN.</li><li><strong>How to get there:</strong> by car 40 min via DK 81. By public transport about 1.5 hours. First, get on the Koleje Śląskie train going to Łaziska Górne (leaves every hour, price 5 PLN, about 20 minutes), then bus 69 &#8211; get off at the Żory Dworcowa stop, from where you have a 5-minute walk.</li></ul>



<h2>The Museum of Silesian Uprisings &#8211; Świętochłowice</h2>



<p>Over the centuries Silesia was inhabited by Poles, Germans, and Czechs. The fluid borders in the region meant that for hundreds of years the influences and interests of all three nations mixed because of the changing borders and various times parts of Silesia belonged to different countries. The most significant border changes in the 20th century took place after the end of World War I, when the Silesian Uprisings took place in Silesia, i.e. three armed insurrections of Poles residing here against the German state (1919-1921). The insurgents at that time fought for Silesia to join the newly reborn&nbsp; Poland (1919).</p>

<h2>The Guido Mine and The Queen Louise Adit &#8211; Zabrze</h2>



<p>Silesia has long been associated with coal mining. In the past, almost every city in the region had one or even several coal mines. If you want to see what the mines look like and what elements miners have to face every day, then you must visit Zabrze. These are attractions unique in a global scale that will allow you to feel the hardships of mining work and discover the historical heritage of this region.</p>

<p>The open-air museums are located at the original nineteenth-century mines. They are situated less than 2 kilometers from each other and give many reasons to visit. The main ones? A ride down in the mine shaft elevator over 300 meters underground. Venture among the over 200-year-old historical tunnels. Ride by boat on one of the longest underground tunnels in Europe (1100 meters). Travel on a suspended mine train, and if that isn’t enough &#8211; an exceptional beer can be enjoyed in the deepest pub on the continent!</p>

<h2>The Black Trout Adit and The Silver Museum &#8211; Tarnowskie Góry&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Zabrze isn’t the only city in Silesia where you can go underground and see what the work of miners looked like in the past. Equally interesting attractions, included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, are in Tarnowskie Góry. The 18th-century tunnels are a remnant of the &#8220;Fryderyk&#8221; mine, where silver ore was mined. In the Black Trout Adit, an underground boat ride awaits you on a 600-meter route connecting two mine shafts. In the Historic Silver Mine, a journey through the old tunnels from the 18th and 19th centuries can be enjoyed. During the 1.5 km route, we’ll get to know former jobs, tools, and work methods of the miners. The route is enriched with audiovisual effects that allow you to feel the real atmosphere of those times. The museum also has an exciting multimedia exhibition about the geology and history of these attractions, and is next to the Steam Engine Museum.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Princely Brewery &#8211; Tychy</h2>



<p>Although we’ve already offered you one beer during the tour, in the end, we invite you for one more. Tychy is a place that’s probably known to every adult Pole. It’s here that the headquarters of the company is located, which for many years created the brand that is synonymous with Polish beer &#8211; Tyskie. Tourists can visit both the historic brewery, which has been brewing beer for four centuries, and the unique museum with a collection of beer exhibits, mugs, mug coasters, and barrels from around the world. The crowning event of the visit is the tasting of their 14-day Tyskie Gronie in an historic pub. It’s worth considering using public transport. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>Len Arte</h2>



<p>Opened in December 2011, when the places on Mariacka Street could be counted on one hand, and our idea of real Italian pizza was still quite vague. They came first to teach us that pizza mustn’t be topped with pineapple, drowned in garlic sauce and ordered half-in-half. And more! They don’t serve latte or cappuccino, as it is not a breakfast place. In the afternoon, all the Italians drink is espresso (with a drop of milk maybe).</p>



<p>From the very beginning, Len Arte was faithful to their idea of a small Italian eatery, serving traditional food, which might have been prepared by an Italian nonna just as well. The short seasonal menu includes Italian antipasti, a few main courses and a sensational menu of the day. However, the most important spot belongs (and hopefully always will) to pizza, which has been like a Sèvres standard for Katowice residents for eight years.</p>



<p>A huge wood-fired oven, a real Italian chef in the kitchen, original products supplied straight from Italy. It might be a standard now, but when Len Arte set off, we could not believe our eyes while licking tomato sauce off of our fingers. If we had to leave with a bad taste in our mouths, it was because instead of the red-hot oven we were welcomed by a note on the door: the owners had left for Italy (attending their friends&#8217; wedding and collecting the ingredients on their way).</p>



<p>Len Arte has done a great job. And most importantly – they stick to their high standards. The place is authentic, and the seasonal menu tempts with rarities less known or available in Poland – <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="8" data-gr-id="8">cime</g> di <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">rapa</g> or white truffles. Way to go, we love returning to their lovely outdoor seating in the summertime, to savor the perfect macchiato in the shade of olive trees. In the winter, we choose a little table by the window, where the coziness of herb-smelling place makes the winter quite bearable after all.</p>

<h2><strong>’<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">novo</g> (+ Sezo’novo)</strong></h2>



<p>From Mariacka Street we take a short walk to Warszawska. There we find the ’novo restobar. A marriage of an Italian restaurant and a good cocktail bar is a grand idea in itself. But there comes the key element–brilliant pizza.</p>



<p>As Italian cuisine lovers, Katowice residents know all to0 well that ’novo is the younger brother of Sezo’novo project, which feeds us excellent pizza in Park Leśny near Dolina Trzech Stawów. Summer in Poland is short though, and fans of Sezo’novo pizza long for it and despair from October to April, so the founders decided to build upon their success and open a year-round place. That’s how ’novo was launched three years ago. And with it – the pizza: exceptionally thin, crunchy, and perfectly baked. There are also hand-made pastas and other specialties straight from the kitchen of chef Witek Wróbel and his talented crew. Add a selection of regional Italian wines, aromatic coffee, desserts, home-made bread, and focaccia.</p>



<p>From Mondays to Fridays, it serves a three-course lunch at a reasonable price, while in the evenings and over the weekends you can sit there with your friends, sipping a cocktail with a selection of original Italian antipasti. When the warmer days come again, feel invited to their charming courtyard garden and take a peek in the kitchen and the chefs at work as you wait for your order. A glass of aperitivo in hand, of course. Before, the end of the season at Sezo’novo meant an impatient countdown to spring. Now, winter comes with an equally delicious perspective.</p>

<h2><strong>Pizza z <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">Pieca</g> [Pizza From the Oven]</strong></h2>



<p>2017 was a real breakthrough on the culinary scene of Katowice. Within a few-kilometer radius, the city started to gradually enjoy new pizza places. And this is another one which has recently celebrated its second birthday and yet has already successfully joined our culinary repertoire. We are presenting Pizza z Pieca. </p>



<p>The concept – as with every good pizza place – is very simple. At its heart is a beechwood oven and a clean-cut menu, focussed on pizza itself. As the place is on the smaller side, the oven and bustling pizzaiolo are the center of attention. What else does it need after all. The homey interior and atmospheric spotlighting on the tables complement the picture. With good-quality original ingredients and several beers and wines, this Italian puzzle makes for a recipe for a successful eatery. The place has quickly gained faithful fans and it’s not always easy to grab a table. Luckily, last spring they opened a new, much larger and covered outdoor seating area, where you can relax and sip your sunny Aperol spritz. </p>



<p>We like this place. We like it a lot. Mainly for its pizza, the sweetness of their San Marzano tomato sauce, and the delicacy of the mozzarella di <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="8" data-gr-id="8">bufala</g>. We also like it for being a simple, genuine place, which cares for what’s most important – the pizza itself. We’re rooting for them and we’ll keep coming back. Definitely drop by. </p>

<h2><strong>Ludzie Mówią Różne Rzeczy [People Say Different Things]</strong></h2>



<p>Searching for the pizza ideal, we are leaving Katowice, temporarily. In Chorzów, next door, we find a real gem, worth taking a <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="15" data-gr-id="15">longer</g> walk across Park Śląski – the Silesia Park. People say different things, but about this pizza place – they have long been saying only good things. Opened in May 2017 (what a prolific year), this lovely eatery has gained a close circle of fans, who are willing to abandon Katowice for this pizza anytime. </p>



<p>The heart of ”Ludzie” – traditionally: a huge wood-fired oven, which delivers right to our table – the pizza. On thin crust, with original ingredients and unconventional toppings (would you even think of topping your pizza with lovage? We tasted it and it did the trick!). Numerous options do allow for an easy choice. If you can’t decide by ingredients, follow the names, which – as much as the name of the place itself – are far from obvious. ”We ate at Nolio”, ”I’m out in my garden” or ”Attacking Mediocrity” are only some of the ”humane” propositions.</p>



<p>And if you don’t feel like having pizza at all, there are quite a lot of other dishes on the menu: oven grilled veggies served with pizza bread, delightful gnocchi with a selection of sauces, and panini. For the less hungry (and more numerous at the table), it is worth ordering a board of original cheeses and cold meats. Those hungrier will appreciate the hand-made home-made pastas. In the summer, the guests have the front outdoor seating area at their disposal. Whoever hesitates whether to eat indoor or outdoor, may find their patch on the mini-balcony, with a small countertop and a few chairs. It’s perfect to savor a little Italian bite. </p>



<p>It’s nice that Chorzów has a place like that. And that it’s next door!</p>

<h2>Vera Napoli</h2>



<p>Had enough of gnocchi? It’s time we returned to Katowice. Back to Warszawska Street. Passing by ’novo this time, only to lounge in another Italian place. Welcome to Naples!</p>



<p>First things first… There was the city of Tychy and the La Fontana restaurant. A traditional Neapolitan pizza place, with pizza a bit different from what we have just learned about. A soft crust, much more puffed at the edges, moister toppings – pizza napoletana in the flesh. The fame of the Tychy pizzeria La Fontana, about to celebrate its third birthday at the end of October, has been running through the air like the aroma of melting cheese. Katowice was waiting, a bit envious, but they came. Since March 2019 real Neapolitan pizza has been served by Vera Napoli – La Fontana’s younger sister.</p>



<p>Its interior resembles an expensive restaurant rather than a cramped and buzzy Italian place. The decor of marble, large windows, golden accents – truly elegant and classy. Although the restaurant is extremely busy since <g class="gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="26" data-gr-id="26">their</g> opening, its two floors offer quite a lot of room. The pizza itself surely differs from the ones discussed before, but the essentials remain unchanged – a huge <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">wood</g><g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace gr-progress" id="20" data-gr-id="20">&#8211;</g><g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">fired</g> oven, original Italian ingredients, and hand-kneaded dough. In July, Vera Napoli also launched its “small kitchen” and serves home-made pastas and antipasti, which makes the fans of other Italian <g class="gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="28" data-gr-id="28">specialities</g> quite content.</p>



<p>Whoever hasn’t acquired a taste for Neapolitan pizza yet, make your way to Warszawska Street. Then, cutlery in hand (because that’s how you eat pizza napoletana: with a knife and fork) and get to it! Buon appetito!</p>

<p><strong>The spring and summer period is a perfect time to get to know the greener side of Silesia and take a walk or go for a bike ride around one of the unique areas that our region abounds with. Today we would like to show you 6 interesting places around Katowice, which will enchant everyone with their unique natural beauty. Welcome to Pszczyna, Bytom, and Mikołów. You can reach all these places from Katowice in 30-60 minutes by public transport or by car. Well, unless you hop on your bike from the city center&#8230;</strong></p>



<h2>Cycling Route Katowice &#8211; Pszczyna: It’s Good to go Cycling in the Woods</h2>



<p>Although reaching a destination is vital, sometimes the road that leads to it is an attraction in itself. This will be the case if you hop on your two wheels and head south. Katowice is a city designed for cyclists, and the bike route to Pszczyna is a real classic. Importantly, the ride can start in the very center of Katowice, as the route starts in the Park Powstańców. This is where you’ll find the red markings of the trail that leads you directly to the village, called by some, the Pearl of Upper Silesia. </p>



<p>The route is about 50 kilometers long, but you don&#8217;t have to cycle without stopping. Moreover, it would be difficult considering the number of attractive stopovers that encourage you to take a break on your way. This bike path, for instance, goes through the recreational area of&nbsp; Trzy Stawy (“Three Ponds”), the reserve of &#8220;Kłodnica Springs&#8221;&nbsp; close to Lake Paprocany near Tychy and crosses the charming Kobiórskie forest. But, the biggest attractions are probably at the end of this fascinating route, which will be described further below.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Length</strong>: Approx. 50 km (one way).</li><li><strong>Admission</strong>: free.</li><li><strong>Return</strong>: If the return from Pszczyna on your bike seems too exhausting, you can avail of the services of Koleje Śląskie [Silesian Railways]. Pszczyna is well connected to Katowice and&nbsp;bicycles are allowed to be carried on KŚ trains. The fare, including the bike, is about 15 zlotys and the journey is just over 30 minutes.</li></ul>



<h2>Palace Park in Pszczyna: A Walk with History in the Background</h2>



<p>Featured at the beginning, the Red Bicycle Trail from Katowice will also lead you to the walls of the historic palace in Pszczyna (but you can also reach this place driving or using public transport). Surrounded by greenery, this stately building has a long and beautiful history. Erected in the 11th or 12th century and repeatedly rebuilt, today it is regarded as a Neo-baroque gem. Now, this historic interior has been turned into a museum.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we’ll be more interested in its enchanting surroundings. Within this 156 hectare area,&nbsp;there is a beautiful park, arranged in the 2nd half of the 19th century in British style. It means that its appearance refers to the landscapes present in nature. For many years this complex has been enticing walkers with alleys interlacing picturesque lakes and cozy bridges thrown over lazily flowing rivers.</p>



<p>Located on the Islet in the Palace Park (Park Palacowy) the Daisy Tea Room has been attracting crowds of tourists recently. There you’ll find a rich selection of teas, lemonades, coffees, and delicious cakes and desserts. Strongly recommended after an intense walk or bike ride!</p>

<h2>Zagroda Żubrów (Bison Farm) in Pszczyna: King of the Forest in the City Center</h2>



<p>Pszczyna is a place recommended for a little longer stay. In addition to the interesting market square, it prides itself on the most powerful European mammal, the bison. Not so long ago these dignified animals were on the verge of extinction. Today you can meet them in a specially dedicated part of the park called the &#8220;Bison Farm&#8221;.</p>



<p>Nature lovers can preview the habits of these giant mammals using a convenient observation platform. You can also brush up on your knowledge of nature. There is a movie portraying this interesting animal, which can be watched in a small cinema room next door.</p>



<p>Although the bison is the real king of the park, it’s also accompanied by other animals, such as mouflons, deer, does, fallow deer, and several species of birds. It’s virtually a ZOO!</p>

<h2>Silesian Botanical Garden: Captivating Plants and an Extensive Panorama</h2>



<p>Fiołkowa Góra (Violet Mountain) is an inconspicuous hill located within the borders of Mikołów. Certainly, nobody would have heard of it if it hadn&#8217;t been for the so-called ‘natural inventory’ in 1996. It was demonstrated that the slopes of that relatively low hill and adjacent region with the two streams Promny and Jasienica were abundant with precious plant species. It was decided that good use should be made of those fallow lands taking into account their natural potential. Today Fiołkowa Góra is a bustling place. There’s the unique Silesian Botanical Garden, which is frequently visited by many, not only by Mikołów residents. </p>



<p>In numerous flower beds and squares grow various plants, eye-catching, and delighting us with their scents. Visitors can admire the exhibitions of nature photos whilst strolling around the area. A dense network of alleys, numerous benches, pleasant cafés, magnificent panoramas, and the observation tower (reaching as far as the Beskid mountains)&nbsp; &#8211; these attractions will definitely convince you to head for Mikołów on a nice and warm weekend.</p>

<h2>Segiet Reserve: UNESCO &#8211; A Primeval Forest</h2>



<p>Bytom is one of the oldest towns in Silesia, known for its long-standing mining traditions dating back to the Middle Ages. However, the city’s famous not only for its rich history but, also for the unique Silesian nature, whose extraordinary character was internationally recognized when this reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Reserve list. </p>



<p>If you want to see the original beech forest once growing in the region of Silesia, you must go to Segiet for a walk or a bike ride. Located in the area of abandoned mines, the reserve is located on the slopes of Srebrna Gora (347 m above sea level). Every nature lover will be enthralled with it. In the vicinity of the city, you’ll find enormous majestic beech trees 130-150 years old and rich fauna abundant with amphibians, reptiles, and birds. There’s a trail named &#8220;Las Segiecki&#8221; in the reserve,&nbsp; which facilitates moving around this extraordinary place.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Admission:</strong> Free.</li><li><strong>Travel</strong>: By car: the easiest way is to reach road 11&nbsp; from Bytom or Tarnowskie Góry.  Enter Blachówka street, at the end of which there is a small car park. It is about 40 min from Katowice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Silesian Railways: head for Tarnowskie Góry (approx. 50 min, cost 4 PLN), then take&nbsp; 289 bus. The best option is to take your bike on the train to  Bytom Północ station (approx. 10 PLN, travel time 35 min), and then from there, it takes 25 min by bike.</li></ul>



<h2>The Dolomites (Dolomity), Sports Valley (Sportowa Dolina) and Blachówka</h2>



<p>The commercial mining in the area of Bytom and Tarnowskie Góry can be specifically seen in the area of Blachówka quarry, adjacent to the nature reserve Segiet. When after many centuries of mining, commercial mining ended in 1990 and the land was eventually returned to nature. A several dozen &#8211; meter long slope of Triassic deposits and the interior of the valley (known to locals as ‘Great Canyon’ ),&nbsp;with trees and shrubs growing again, create an extraordinary atmosphere and make this place an attractive recreational area.</p>



<p>Today Blachówka is one of the most favorite places for walking and cycling, not only for Bytom residents but also for the inhabitants of&nbsp;all of Silesia. The mountain atmosphere in the heart of the Silesian metropolitan area is emphasized by the year-round sports facility built near the quarry-the Dolomites Sports Valley, where in winter you can go skiing and snowboarding. There is also a restaurant there with an interesting view of the valley, open all year round.</p>

<p><strong>The rising environmental awareness and resulting anxiety about the condition of our planet make us willing to change. We are ready for action and want to participate in the fight to improve the quality of our life. Where to start? The best and the simplest way – at home,&nbsp; revising our daily habits. </strong></p>



<p>In our previous article (<a href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/how-to-be-eco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="link here (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">link here</a>) we were convincing you about the importance of careful planning in changing our habits. You could learn where to find local suppliers and seasonal produce, and how to avoid things going to waste. We might have even persuaded you into drinking tap water? Today we are taking another step, encouraging you to give a second chance and go to the green side of the force. How? Read on!</p>



<h2>Cut down on plastic</h2>



<p>Have you ever wondered how many kilograms of plastic are “produced” by a statistical European? According to WWF, 31 kg. And only 30% is recycled. How to declare a private war on plastic? The simplest way possible – reducing the amount you use.  <br>Take reusable lunch-boxes to work. If you cannot be bothered with the glass ones, heavy and easily damaged, get a bamboo box. It can also be taken to a restaurant – ask the staff to pack your leftovers, and they surely will. Do not put a straw in your glass – you will probably only use it to stir your drink once.<br>If you must use disposable cutlery, choose the wooden kind. They are not only eco-friendly, but also much more appealing. <br>Try and eliminate disposable packagings, especially plastic carrier bags. Going shopping, take your own reusable bag and keep it at hand – in your purse, in your car. Cut down on plastic bags as well – a bunch of bananas or some oranges can well be put in your shopping trolley on their own.<br>The environmental awareness is also on the rise among retailers – slowly, products sold by weight are starting to be packed in paper bags.  And some shops will even fill in your own boxes. This solution is already used by the retail store of Gospodarstwo Agroturystyczne Pliczko [Pliczko Agrotourism Farm] at Hetmańska Street in Katowice.

<h2>Give a second chance</h2>



<p>We do not mean interpersonal relationships (although it is always worth a try), but your relationship with the things you own. We do buy much more than we need: food as well as clothes, devices, gadgets. <br>Obviously, the most sensible way would be limiting the purchase. But – easier said than done. Once you have decided to part ways with something, give it a second life by selling or simply giving it away – put it up on popular online services.<br>Planning redecoration, take another look at your furniture. Could repainting the fronts or changing the upholstery on the chairs give them a totally new character? Browse the flea markets, where you can hunt some truly unique items.<br>Renovation of old furniture is on the rise. If you have never tried and do not know where to start, learn! For example at the <em>DeKato</em> cooperative at Warszawska Street in Katowice; they regularly organize workshops on all things manual. Be inspired by the omnipresent online DIY tutorials and ideas. <br>We all know about recycling, and upcycling? As the only city in Poland, Katowice has an upcycling showroom – UPstore, where the strangest things are remade into new designer’s gadgets – from furniture, lamps, all the way to jewelry. Pop in there to find your inspiration. Maybe you will spot something you like?</p>

<h2>Sort your waste</h2>



<p>But how? In my apartment house? On the tenth floor? Well, yes. Most of the home-improvement stores sell graceful recycling bins, which easily fit under the kitchen worktop. They can be heaped up, using an empty corner behind the fridge or the kitchen door. <br>The Katowice cooperatives increasingly care to provide recycling containers at their developments. Recently, also the bins for organic waste have been put up. Surely, it might be more problematic than sorting plastic, but taking out a small package on your way to work should not be that troublesome? <br>If you don’t know where to start sorting your home waste, let it be a separate, larger garbage bag – glass or cartons stuff most of your bin, and they do not need taking out as often as the organic waste. And then, once in a while, carry downstairs this bag of paper or glass bottles (well, there is no Prosecco on our taps yet&#8230;).</p>

<h2>Get moving</h2>



<p>Sport is good for you, right? How about sometimes, when the weather is nice, you leave your car behind and cycle to work? It is good for the environment, it is good for your health and fitness. And no worries about finding a parking spot&#8230;<br>Going from point A to point B, rent a bike – there are several tens of City by Bike stations in Katowice and the network is expanding. Reaching any place in the city by bike should not be a problem. Rental fee is truly symbolic and it is all within one convenient phone application. <br>If the weather is no good (too hot, too cold, pouring rain), take a tram or a train. Most of the Silesia agglomeration is well-communicated, so there is no point in holding on to your car habits. Recently, the entire Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia and Dąbrowa Basin (GZM) has introduced one common ticket – metrobilet. Train, tram, bus – all in one package!<br>A lack of paper ticket shouldn’t be an excuse. All you need to do is to download one of the handy apps, that allows you to check public transport schedule and buy a ticket directly on your phone. Our favorite apps are: jakdojade.pl, moBILET and mPay (all available in English). Download them and see how easy it is!</p>

<h2>Take to the green</h2>



<p>Forests are the lungs of our planet. They filter the air and tirelessly turn carbon dioxide into life-giving oxygen. But good news to all who like potted flowers: plants in your apartment work as a natural air purifier and bravely clean it of carbon monoxide, ammonia or nicotine. There is something for a fan of the common ivy, the good old fern or the more exotic date palm. Amateurs of unusual plants will appreciate the intricate asparagus, while greenery lovers should put their bet on spath plant.<br>You may not have green fingers, but do not give up on green window sill. Simply choose plants resistant to your forgetfulness and longer cuts in water supply. Aloes and dracaena are perfect for beginners – they do not need frequent watering, but still have the magic filtrating properties. The good-natured spider plant likes to be watered lavishly, but will adapt to every spot of your flat – from sunny sills to shadowed corners. <br>How many plants? At least one per 10m<sup>2</sup>. No upper limit. For potted plants we recommend a trip to Geszeft in Katowice Koszutka – they have truly beautiful green specimens.</p>

<p>What exactly distinguishes this reservoir from others in the area? It’s how perfectly Paprocany’s nature harmonizes with modern architectural forms. Some time ago the lake underwent a complete transformation. An unusual beauty was created, the wooden promenade rich with interesting recreational facilities. People seeking relaxation can sit back on somewhat futuristic benches with sunshades or lie in comfortable hammocks integrated into the structure of the promenade. The youngest will be happy to avail of the offer of Poland&#8217;s first water playground, and lovers of evening walks will feast their eyes on a multi-colored performance after dark by beautifully lit fountains.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>#2 Sosnowiec Wake Zone Stawiki: emotions on a wave</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of water activities, head towards Sosnowiec. The Wake Zone Stawiki park should be on the bucket list of people on a wave, who are looking for refreshment in summer. In 2013, a real Wake Park was opened in the water area near Stadion Ludowy. From that moment, the building was systematically retrofitted. Today, thrill seekers and enthusiasts of water attractions have at their fingertips a large wakeboard lift and a giant obstacle course created from inflatable forms floating on the water. Now, after a long and emotional struggle, visitors coming to Sosnowiec can finally sit in one of the gastronomic facilities&nbsp; to partake of the nutritious delicacies served there.</p>

<h2>#3 Dąbrowa Górnicza: Biała Przemsza gorge: a favorite place for canoeists</h2>



<p>Although it is not a typical highland river, it displays certain mountain river characteristics as it flows quite fast for a lowland stream. The Biała Przemsza river, which is quite an inconspicuous river flowing through towns such as Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, Mysłowice, and Jaworzno, used to share its riverbed with the Czarna Przemsza river and the Przemsza river, which together once marked the so-called Triangle of Three Emperors. We’re not going to elaborate on that, though, as this is a topic for history enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Today the Biała Przemsza appears mainly as a place created for leisure activity, for example canoeing! Enthusiasts of this sport can be found in different parts of the less than 64-kilometer-long watercourse, but the most popular is the gorge of the Biała Przemsza in Dąbrowa Górnicza -Kradzionów. At that point, the river is radically changing: it becomes wider and deeper, turns sharply and begins to meander. This sudden metamorphosis gives it charm and attracts paddling enthusiasts. If you are a canoeist, you will definitely be loving it!</p>



<p><strong>Rafting on the White Przemsza River</strong>: prices from 70 PLN<br><strong>Access:</strong> To Sławków, where most of the rafting starts, about a 30 minute drive by car from the center of Katowice. <br><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://przemsza.pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://przemsza.pl/ (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">https://przemsza.pl/</a><br></p>



<h2>#4 Pogoria: everyone gets&nbsp; active</h2>



<p>Bicycling, rollerblading, Nordic walking, kayaking, jet skiing, sail boating, and many other outdoor activities. Pogoria is a complex of four water reservoirs formed in Dąbrowa Górnicza in the abandoned sand pits where sand used to be extracted&nbsp; for the surrounding mines.

<p>&#8220;Little Croatia&#8221; is a place specially arranged for you to spend a pleasant time. The wooden footbridges, the pier, the gazebo, and the vantage points are pleasant places to relax. Furthermore, they make a stylish background for pictures. Thanks to the convenient cycling paths, the lakes have become a popular destination for cyclists, and the underwater world tempts diving fans.&nbsp; The local tourist infrastructure is new, but it’s not much older than&#8230; the lakes themselves. They were created completely by chance. The owners of the quarries did not pay their electric bills. When the electric company cut off the power, the pump ceased to work. It only took a few dozen hours for the quarries to turn into picturesque ponds.</p>



<p><strong>Free admission</strong><br><strong>Directions:</strong> Car approx. 30 min, Polish railways approx. 30 min. (Price from 5 zł),&nbsp; get off at Jaworzno Szczakowa station and  get on 314 bus , after 5 minutes get off at the stop at the Pieska Dive centre, and it takes just 15 minutes to get to the quarry on foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Environmental awareness in society is on the rise. We pay attention to the problems of food waste, lack of drinking water, and especially concerning recently, air pollution. The condition of our planet does make us anxious, but deep in our hearts we hope for solutions. However, there is no miracle cure and the changes can only be made step by step, as we all play our part.</strong></p>



<p>In June, “Forbes” named Katowice the most eco-friendly city in Poland, mainly in appreciation for its fight against smog. Surely, a good example should come from the top, which does not mean we can remain passive. Every action has a real influence on our reality. Let’s begin at home with changing our daily habits. How?&nbsp;You’ll find some tips in the first part of our eco-handbook. </p>



<h2>Save</h2>



<p>We’ve been told this since childhood – mainly with respect to money. Therefore, when we started earning our first “grown-up” money and could finally afford to make our first small dreams come true, the whole saving thing became much less appealing. However, we have slowly learned to understand it in a context wider than finances. It’s just as important to save what is scarce in nature or what affects our environment when produced – mainly water and electricity.<br>Water may be included in your rent, which does not have to mean doing your dishes with the water running. Just like with brushing your teeth and for you men, when shaving – simply turn the water off when possible. As the lucky owner of a bathtub, you don’t need to fill it to the brim to enjoy a lavish bath, have a tub will do. <br>Another thing is electricity. The small savings will not show instantly, but little by little does the trick. Turn the lights off when you leave a room. When you’re leaving home for the weekend unplug the chargers and make sure your devices are not on stand-by. Replace regular light bulbs with LED. Do the laundry when you actually have a full load. <br>Save paper – don’t print unnecessary invoices or e-mails and use both sides of your notebook pages. Use your smartphone ”Notes” and ”Calendar” – it’s usually at hand anyway, and all the files can be easily edited and shared with others. We aren’t saying stop buying books (which we love), but if your favorite newspaper comes in the e-version, use it. The life span of the printed one is as long as it takes for you to read it, plus a couple more days lying around the sofa after all.</p>



<h2>Drink Tap Water</h2>



<p>Over 2 billion people in the world have no access to drinking water. Sounds scary, doesn’t it? Statistics aside, we have our daily rituals. How about a big sip of tap water?<br>In Katowice, the quality of city water is good enough to drink safely. The city authorities and its KatoObywatel [KatoCitizen] initiative run the program #szluknijsiezkokotka [drink from the tap] and recommend it as cheaper and more eco. This initiative is increasingly being joined by Katowice pubs and restaurants, which serve tap water for free (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here you can find a list (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://katoobywatel.katowice.eu/nasze-akcje/kranowka-katowicka-szluknij-sie-z-kokotka/" target="_blank">here you can find a list</a>).<br>Drinking tap water is also directly connected with the issue of plastic overuse – drinking the recommended 2–3 liters of water, we throw away at least one plastic bottle a day, and this comes up to several hundred a year! Plus a six-pack of water makes for heavy lifting when it comes to replenishing the stock&#8230;<br>If you’re not sure about drinking straight from the tap, invest in a water filter pitcher. When leaving home, take a reusable bottle and refill it regularly. Every Friday and Saturday in the summer, hit the market square for a glass of refreshing “tap water” from the soda fountain sponsored by the city and the Katowice Water Department.<br>There’s also great news for the passengers at Pyrzowice airport – the A and B terminals have been recently equipped with watering stations where you can refill your water bottle. No more stress to find the expensive bottled water before departure. Finally!</p>

<h2>Plan Ahead</h2>



<p>According to the FAO (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), the world wastes ⅓ of its food a year. This amount is hard to imagine looking at a standard fridge. However, having opened it you do find things good for nothing but the trash. You bought something on sale, or because they came in cheaper multi-packs, or because the third one was almost free. Sounds familiar? It’s time to plan ahead! <br>A shopping list will make it easier to navigate the shop aisles. Instead of writing it down on a piece of paper, download one of the grocery shopping list apps like Listonic.<br>When faced with a “bargain”, ask yourself: Do I really need this? It will help you plan your shopping budget and not be surprised at the checkout. All this to the benefit of our planet and your wallet alike, reducing the risk of some of your shopping landing in the trash.</p>

<h2><strong>Buy Locally and Responsibly</strong></h2>



<p>Don’t go raspberry hunting in December and hold off your cravings for ripe tomatoes in February. Limit your consumption of what travels tens of thousands of kilometers before filling your shopping cart. The increasing demand for fashionable foods, especially “exotic” ones, leaves its mark on the environment. Have you heard about the forests being cut down so that oil palms can be planted? But, did you know about a similar situation concerning avocados? Mexico’s pine forests also being cut down so avocado trees can be planted.<br>Instead of marveling over the goji berry, go to your local market and see what is in season. In the center of Katowice, you can find several great market places, such as in Koszutka or at Plac Miarki. On Wednesday and Saturday take a large bag and visit the Biobazar in the former Huta Baildon [Baildon Steelworks]. You will be able to buy fruit and vegetables, dairy products, meat, and a plethora of other products from proven local suppliers. Interestingly, in Biobazar, your purchases will also be packed in your own containers.<br>The eco-friendy approach refers to cosmetics as well – they may be a bit more expensive, but you can be sure that they use only natural and eco-friendly ingredients. Whenever possible, choose small manufacturers that focus on the process as well as effects. An interesting and convenient solution – not only for travelers – are the multitask cosmetics, functioning as shower gel, shampoo, and soap for example. The “smart” bars are space-saving as well as cost-efficient. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>At Bio Bazar you can get local fruits and veggies, organic products, and even artisan cosmetics.</em></p>



<h2>Share</h2>



<p>Another piece of sound advice, which turns out to be tough to follow: whatever you use, use to the last drop, crumb, and piece. Quite a lot can be squeezed out of a seemingly empty tube of toothpaste or cream. Start with using the products you bought first, following the FIFO principle (First In, First Out). And if you know you will not be able to finish something and there is the risk that half of your mum’s Christmas stock will land in the trash, share it. All year long, food can be donated to your nearest soup kitchen and you can find the full list at<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://podzielmysie.pl/jadlodajnie-2/" target="_blank"> podzielmysie.pl</a>. Simply take the excess food to the given address. Over Christmas and Easter, there are special programs and a volunteer will pick the food up at your place. The dates and details are provided on their websites and Facebook. And if you are the one who wants to “hunt” for something in the no-waste spirit, use the Foodsi app, where restaurants offer left-over food from the day at half price. Also, in Katowice, Foodsi is being joined by the first eateries – download the app and catch the bargains!</p>



<p><strong>Old habits die hard. It takes engagement and changing your routines. Start with small, everyday practices, and see how quickly they become second nature. And sometimes, raise a refreshing glass of tap water to the health of our planet!</strong></p>
