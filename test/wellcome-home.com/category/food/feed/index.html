<p><strong>Do you happen to know anyone who doesn’t like Italy or Italian pizza? Neither do we.<g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style replaceWithoutSep gr-progress sel" id="9" data-gr-id="9"> </g>Sunny Italia may be too far for a daily trip, but the real pizza is not. For a few years now, in Katowice (and nearby) you can have tasty and truly Italian food. We’ll tell you where.</strong></p>



<p>Some prefer the simplest version, with tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil. Others like their pizza loaded – with different types of cheese, spicy meat, <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="8" data-gr-id="8">rucola</g> and parmesan flakes. Regardless of your favorite pizza topping, it must be authentic – prepared from original ingredients, on hand-kneaded crust, from a wood oven. Let us take you on a journey to Italy. Andiamo, <g class="gr_ gr_36 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="36" data-gr-id="36">ragazzi</g>!</p>



<h2>Len Arte</h2>



<p>Opened in December 2011, when the places on Mariacka Street could be counted on one hand, and our idea of real Italian pizza was still quite vague. They came first to teach us that pizza mustn’t be topped with pineapple, drowned in garlic sauce and ordered half-in-half. And more! They don’t serve latte or cappuccino, as it is not a breakfast place. In the afternoon, all the Italians drink is espresso (with a drop of milk maybe).</p>



<p>From the very beginning, Len Arte was faithful to their idea of a small Italian eatery, serving traditional food, which might have been prepared by an Italian nonna just as well. The short seasonal menu includes Italian antipasti, a few main courses and a sensational menu of the day. However, the most important spot belongs (and hopefully always will) to pizza, which has been like a Sèvres standard for Katowice residents for eight years.</p>



<p>A huge wood-fired oven, a real Italian chef in the kitchen, original products supplied straight from Italy. It might be a standard now, but when Len Arte set off, we could not believe our eyes while licking tomato sauce off of our fingers. If we had to leave with a bad taste in our mouths, it was because instead of the red-hot oven we were welcomed by a note on the door: the owners had left for Italy (attending their friends&#8217; wedding and collecting the ingredients on their way).</p>



<p>Len Arte has done a great job. And most importantly – they stick to their high standards. The place is authentic, and the seasonal menu tempts with rarities less known or available in Poland – <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="8" data-gr-id="8">cime</g> di <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">rapa</g> or white truffles. Way to go, we love returning to their lovely outdoor seating in the summertime, to savor the perfect macchiato in the shade of olive trees. In the winter, we choose a little table by the window, where the coziness of herb-smelling place makes the winter quite bearable after all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Mangia, bevi, ama [eat, drink, love] &#8211; the philosophy of happiness according to Len Arte.</em></p>



<ul><li><strong>Where?</strong> 25 Mariacka Street</li><li><strong>When?</strong> Tue–Thu and Sun 1 pm–10 pm | Fri–Sat 1 pm–12 pm</li></ul>



<h2><strong>’<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">novo</g> (+ Sezo’novo)</strong></h2>



<p>From Mariacka Street we take a short walk to Warszawska. There we find the ’novo restobar. A marriage of an Italian restaurant and a good cocktail bar is a grand idea in itself. But there comes the key element–brilliant pizza.</p>



<p>As Italian cuisine lovers, Katowice residents know all to0 well that ’novo is the younger brother of Sezo’novo project, which feeds us excellent pizza in Park Leśny near Dolina Trzech Stawów. Summer in Poland is short though, and fans of Sezo’novo pizza long for it and despair from October to April, so the founders decided to build upon their success and open a year-round place. That’s how ’novo was launched three years ago. And with it – the pizza: exceptionally thin, crunchy, and perfectly baked. There are also hand-made pastas and other specialties straight from the kitchen of chef Witek Wróbel and his talented crew. Add a selection of regional Italian wines, aromatic coffee, desserts, home-made bread, and focaccia.</p>



<p>From Mondays to Fridays, it serves a three-course lunch at a reasonable price, while in the evenings and over the weekends you can sit there with your friends, sipping a cocktail with a selection of original Italian antipasti. When the warmer days come again, feel invited to their charming courtyard garden and take a peek in the kitchen and the chefs at work as you wait for your order. A glass of aperitivo in hand, of course. Before, the end of the season at Sezo’novo meant an impatient countdown to spring. Now, winter comes with an equally delicious perspective.</p>

<h2><strong>Pizza z <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">Pieca</g> [Pizza From the Oven]</strong></h2>



<p>2017 was a real breakthrough on the culinary scene of Katowice. Within a few-kilometer radius, the city started to gradually enjoy new pizza places. And this is another one which has recently celebrated its second birthday and yet has already successfully joined our culinary repertoire. We are presenting Pizza z Pieca. </p>



<p>The concept – as with every good pizza place – is very simple. At its heart is a beechwood oven and a clean-cut menu, focussed on pizza itself. As the place is on the smaller side, the oven and bustling pizzaiolo are the center of attention. What else does it need after all. The homey interior and atmospheric spotlighting on the tables complement the picture. With good-quality original ingredients and several beers and wines, this Italian puzzle makes for a recipe for a successful eatery. The place has quickly gained faithful fans and it’s not always easy to grab a table. Luckily, last spring they opened a new, much larger and covered outdoor seating area, where you can relax and sip your sunny Aperol spritz. </p>



<p>We like this place. We like it a lot. Mainly for its pizza, the sweetness of their San Marzano tomato sauce, and the delicacy of the mozzarella di <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="8" data-gr-id="8">bufala</g>. We also like it for being a simple, genuine place, which cares for what’s most important – the pizza itself. We’re rooting for them and we’ll keep coming back. Definitely drop by. </p>

<h2><strong>Ludzie Mówią Różne Rzeczy [People Say Different Things]</strong></h2>



<p>Searching for the pizza ideal, we are leaving Katowice, temporarily. In Chorzów, next door, we find a real gem, worth taking a <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling" id="15" data-gr-id="15">longer</g> walk across Park Śląski – the Silesia Park. People say different things, but about this pizza place – they have long been saying only good things. Opened in May 2017 (what a prolific year), this lovely eatery has gained a close circle of fans, who are willing to abandon Katowice for this pizza anytime. </p>



<p>The heart of ”Ludzie” – traditionally: a huge wood-fired oven, which delivers right to our table – the pizza. On thin crust, with original ingredients and unconventional toppings (would you even think of topping your pizza with lovage? We tasted it and it did the trick!). Numerous options do allow for an easy choice. If you can’t decide by ingredients, follow the names, which – as much as the name of the place itself – are far from obvious. ”We ate at Nolio”, ”I’m out in my garden” or ”Attacking Mediocrity” are only some of the ”humane” propositions.</p>



<p>And if you don’t feel like having pizza at all, there are quite a lot of other dishes on the menu: oven grilled veggies served with pizza bread, delightful gnocchi with a selection of sauces, and panini. For the less hungry (and more numerous at the table), it is worth ordering a board of original cheeses and cold meats. Those hungrier will appreciate the hand-made home-made pastas. In the summer, the guests have the front outdoor seating area at their disposal. Whoever hesitates whether to eat indoor or outdoor, may find their patch on the mini-balcony, with a small countertop and a few chairs. It’s perfect to savor a little Italian bite. </p>



<p>It’s nice that Chorzów has a place like that. And that it’s next door!</p>

<h2>Vera Napoli</h2>



<p>Had enough of gnocchi? It’s time we returned to Katowice. Back to Warszawska Street. Passing by ’novo this time, only to lounge in another Italian place. Welcome to Naples!</p>



<p>First things first… There was the city of Tychy and the La Fontana restaurant. A traditional Neapolitan pizza place, with pizza a bit different from what we have just learned about. A soft crust, much more puffed at the edges, moister toppings – pizza napoletana in the flesh. The fame of the Tychy pizzeria La Fontana, about to celebrate its third birthday at the end of October, has been running through the air like the aroma of melting cheese. Katowice was waiting, a bit envious, but they came. Since March 2019 real Neapolitan pizza has been served by Vera Napoli – La Fontana’s younger sister.</p>



<p>Its interior resembles an expensive restaurant rather than a cramped and buzzy Italian place. The decor of marble, large windows, golden accents – truly elegant and classy. Although the restaurant is extremely busy since <g class="gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="26" data-gr-id="26">their</g> opening, its two floors offer quite a lot of room. The pizza itself surely differs from the ones discussed before, but the essentials remain unchanged – a huge <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">wood</g><g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace gr-progress" id="20" data-gr-id="20">&#8211;</g><g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="20" data-gr-id="20">fired</g> oven, original Italian ingredients, and hand-kneaded dough. In July, Vera Napoli also launched its “small kitchen” and serves home-made pastas and antipasti, which makes the fans of other Italian <g class="gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="28" data-gr-id="28">specialities</g> quite content.</p>



<p>Whoever hasn’t acquired a taste for Neapolitan pizza yet, make your way to Warszawska Street. Then, cutlery in hand (because that’s how you eat pizza napoletana: with a knife and fork) and get to it! Buon appetito!</p>

<p><strong>Aromatic coffee in a loft atmosphere, breakfast at a cozy bistro before work, a hip sandwich on a sunny patio or the best loaf of bread ever for weekend brunch? Below we present our subjective selection of the best breakfast spots. For a good morning check them out!</strong></p>



<p>Katowice is changing in front of our eyes. It is mushrooming with interesting places to sit with an evening glass of wine, pop into for a quick lunch or meet friends for a midday chat. Quite often now, we decide to start the day eating out – have some good coffee, order a special breakfast, set a morning meeting or do a bit of work. Whichever breakfast option you’re after, Katowice has something to offer. </p>



<h2>Byfyj</h2>



<h4>Tea just like at your Grandma&#8217;s</h4>



<p>It’s the sweets-and-coffee classic and a brand in itself. A beautiful, traditional place with soul, where you can have real Silesian yeast cake with sweet crumble or a fresh bun, and drink your tea gazing over the Nikiszowiec market square. The daily delivery of fresh bread and pastry is tended to by Byfyj’s owners, the well-known Katowice Michalski Bakery. Besides the pastry, its standing offer includes breakfasts to satisfy every appetite: from the classic scrambled eggs or Silesian wienerwurst, through a selection of bread and spreads (also vegan), to a variety of sweet bites. </p>



<p>What makes this place positively special, however, is its atmosphere and location. On the ground floor of an historic apartment house, Byfyj’s decoration and traditional tablecloths remind one of a Silesian Grandma’s house. Whoever truly appreciates their tea served in beautiful china and off old dressers (which, <em>nota bene</em>, are called ‘byfyjs’ in the local dialect) is in for a treat.</p>



<p>If you like the Silesian vibe, being charmed by the atmosphere of old Nikiszowiec, and having a really filling breakfast topped with fresh Silesian yeast cake, hurry to Byfyj on a sunny morning to make yourself comfortable on the patio, overlooking the interesting old apartment houses.</p>

<h2>Synergia.dobre miejsce</h2>



<h4>Coffee Station</h4>



<p>In the times when the Poles were still learning to say “espresso” rather than “expresso”, and the word “chemex” carried no associations with coffee whatsoever, Synergia was already there, teaching us what this coffee fun is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standing in the street, you can already see how beautiful this place is – in a large window somebody is sipping their life-giving liquid under a flashy, energetic neon sign. The inside holds much raw wood in a loft vibe, grand windows, and large tables, where you always find a vacant chair to have a seat and drink even the quickest cup. Synergia is a good place for coffee enthusiasts in pursuit of alternative brewing methods – besides the classic Italian beverages, it is worth tasting coffee made in the Chemex, Aeropress, siphon or drip. </p>



<p>Where there is coffee, there is breakfast! Classic or sweet? A little over 10PLN buys you home-made muesli or oatmeal, and the fans of salty options will surely bite into a variety of sandwiches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Synergia is also an ideal place for work or study – despite your laptop and a ton of notes, the large tables will still save a spot for a cup of coffee and a plateful of goodies. If you are not dashing anywhere, make yourself at home and wait until lunch – you will not be disappointed. </p>

<h2>Kafej</h2>



<h4>Bagels all day long</h4>



<p>Przez Kafej do serca – through Kafej to your heart – says the colorful neon sign, referring to the Katowice logo. Accurately, no doubt, as for a few good years Kafej has been close to our hearts and minds. And stomachs, of course. The place has matched the atmosphere of Katowice center and turned the seemingly unappealing busy junction of Chorzowska and Korfantego into a little oasis for those in search of good food in a relaxed casual atmosphere. </p>



<p>Speaking of food, what’s on the menu? Omelets, muesli, pancakes, burritos, and the very reason we have brought you here, the bagel sandwiches. Freshly baked and crunchy, they have become a show-piece of the place. Options are plentiful, including a monthly special (info at the bar).</p>



<p>Bagel sandwiches are only one reason to pop in. There is also an absolutely fantastic summer patio. It is amazing how ingenious the arrangement of a seemingly dull transit square can be. This busy part of town turns into a unique spot. One more thing! Every breakfast menu in Kafej is served until evening, so you are free to stretch your morning into sundown and take your bagel sandwich with a refreshing drink of “Barista’s breakfast”. </p>

<h2>Kolorowo bistro</h2>



<h4>Unpretentious and with heart</h4>



<p>New, small, but atmospheric place. Opened in April, it has accumulated fans, and we are surely among this ever-growing group.</p>



<p>Seated at the corner of Wojewódzka and Sienkiewicza Streets, holding a beautiful high counter with a variety of plants and a row of pastel bar stools, the place looks like a cozy Paris bakery. Fortunately, it is far from the pretentious, over-stylized spots á la France. Quietly filled with pleasant chillout sounds, it lets in gentle daylight through its grand window, and the walls are hung with mirrors in old window frames.</p>



<p>Kolorowo bets on breakfasts, sitting on the menu in four thematic pages (color-coded, of course). Inside, you will find something for the fans of salty and sweet options, bagels and handheld sandwiches, green breakfasts as well. In the summertime you can order iced coffee and colorful bowl of fruit. If you stay a bit longer, from 12 o’clock you can attack lunch as well – on a changeable daily offer you will find soups, salads, meaty bites, dishes to satisfy the dumplings and pasta enthusiasts of any kind. </p>



<p>From behind the small bar, every day you will be tempted by different cakes and cookies, also the gluten-free bread is baked on-site. It is all light, fresh, and affordable – fine to pop in for a nice breakfast before work and taste something else each time.</p>

<h2>Lokal Bakery</h2>



<h4>It all starts with bread</h4>



<p>Whoever has tried Lokal Bakery any weekend morning knows this frenzy – advance orders, lines, faces shocked that all the goods in the baskets are “sold out long ago, ma’am”. That’s what a good craft bread can do.</p>



<p>An unappealing place from the road, nowhere to park. Yet again, however, quality sells itself and makes anyone who has stepped inside – return. Those longing for real, decent sourdough bread with well-baked, almost caramelized crust, will be truly delighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have not heard of this place somehow, call them around Wednesday, order your first-time loaf (or three in one go – frozen, they also do the trick) and with childlike restlessness look forward to Saturday. When it finally comes, be there for the opening, lose the car somewhere on the way (remember, parking is not an option) and on collecting your still-hot miracle, have a sit and indulge yourself with the French breakfast and coffee. And if, by any chance, there is the last pastrami croissant on the counter, grab it for lunch. One more thing, you’d better not tell anyone about this place, because the seats are getting scarce!</p>

<p><strong>Katowice is not Bangkok, but the best flavours of Thailand are nothing strange here. Just like the culinary secrets of other distant parts of Asia, Katowice has its own culinary secrets. On the map of the most interesting pubs in Katowice, there are places where the atmosphere allows you to travel in time and space, and the prices encourage frequent exploration of the menu. Meet 5 interesting spots with oriental cuisine that will pleasantly surprise you.</strong></p>



<p>There are plenty of restaurants on the culinary map of Katowice where excellent chefs serve their guests culinary delights at the highest, world-class level. Certainly, we will devote more than one post on our blog to them. However, this time we will explore those often inconspicuous, charming places offering delicious Asian dishes, great service, and the atmosphere known from the most interesting trips to Asia. Ready to go?</p>



<h2>Hurry Curry</h2>



<p><strong>Asian culinary gems in one place</strong></p>



<p>Imagine a restaurant whose menu consists only of true culinary gems. <em>Hurry Curry </em>does not serve the cuisine of one country, but dishes whose recipes come from various picturesque corners of Asia. A warming Singaporean soup, legendary Chicken Tikka Masala from India, fish curry from Sri Lanka or delicious Lamb Kofta from Kashmir are just the tip of the colorful menu of the Katowice restaurant. Interestingly, the menu includes both vegan and meat options, which makes Hurry Curry appeal to different tastes. Added to this is a fine wine list, a selection of Asian beers, and delicious desserts with fresh Mango Lassi at the forefront. The space of <em>Hurry Curry</em> is filled with huge maps, photographs of people and vibrant places, objects brought from travels, and a whole lot of inspirational culinary books (we are talking about the spot at Stanisława Street). These are elements that not only encourage you to try oriental dishes, but also cause many guests, while still seated at the restaurant table, to start planning a long journey, and not just a culinary one.</p>



<p><strong>WHERE? </strong><br>The popularity of Hurry Curry has increased recently. In Katowice you can find 3 spots:</p>



<ul><li>Stanisława 1</li><li>Panewnicka 25</li><li>Armii Krajowej 81</li></ul>



<p>And if you&#8217;re going to Krakow in the near future, you can visit the fourth spot, Hurry Curry at 9 Szpitalna Street.<br><br><strong>WWW:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://www.hurrycurry.pl/  (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://hurrycurry.pl" target="_blank">https://www.hurrycurry.pl/ </a><br></p>

<h2>Złoty Osioł </h2>



<p><strong>The most colorful vegan restaurant in Katowice </strong></p>



<p>Whoever has been living or studying in Katowice for the last few years must be familiar with Złoty Osioł (The Golden Donkey). The name of the restaurant located at the beginning of Mariacka Street is adequate because the Katowice &#8220;Donkey&#8221; is pure culinary gold. Though on the vegan menu of the restaurant (on top of oriental dishes e.g. the Indian tart with tomato salsa) are dishes from various corners of the world. Złoty Osioł is the quintessence of the Asian way of creating a place with a unique atmosphere. The entrance to Złoty Osioł is like a portal to the magical world of flavors, fragrances, and strong saturated colors that the walls, furniture, and decorations are imbued with. Inspired by the diverse Indian culture, with the decor, a creative menu, and very affordable prices, Złoty Osioł attracts crowds of visitors each day. It is a dynamic and vibrant place with amazing energy, filled to the brim at all times of the day. No wonder; at Złoty Osioł you can always eat a delicious, healthy meal on a budget, get a takeaway dinner or order catering for a special occasion. Additionally, each order is also the opportunity to avail, yourself of the salad bar, which is full of fresh options.</p>

<h2>Masala House</h2>



<p><strong>Indian passion for cooking </strong></p>



<p>Do you want to experience the real taste of Indian cuisine? Go ahead and add  Masala House to your bucket list. Founded almost 7 years ago by Emon Ehsan Muttalib, the restaurant is the quintessence of culinary passion and the best example proving that nobody cooks oriental dishes like the man who has been exposed to them in his home country since birth. Staffed by skilled cooks from different parts of Asia, Masala House is perfectly familiar with the secrets of Indian cuisine. The restaurant menu is like India &#8211; extremely diverse, colorful, and considers individual guests&#8217; expectations. A wide range of tasty starters, aromatic soups, legendary Indian and Indo-Chinese dishes, seafood, and even specialties from the tandoor oven await you. The Masala House menu also contains detailed information about whether the dish is vegetarian, vegan, has meat, is gluten-free or kid-friendly. It is a great tribute to diversity and freedom of choice, which should not be surprising, because … we are in India, right?</p>
