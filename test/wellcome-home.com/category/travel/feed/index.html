<p><strong>Are you wondering what to do with your free weekend? Get moving! Katowice is a great base for exploring, it’s well-connected with other cities, not only in Poland but all over Europe. Let’s go on a trip!</strong></p>



<p>Katowice – the capital and the largest city in the Silesian Province. It’s also the main transportation center for the region and one of the biggest in Poland. You can easily reach it by plane, by car or by train. One of our favorites is the train, taking you directly (and smoothly) to visit not only the entire Silesia, but all of Poland, and a large piece of Europe as well. Once you’ve made yourself at home and started exploring the near and far corners of the region, you’ll have no problem finding many transport possibilities.</p>

<h2><strong>Get on the Right Train</strong></h2>



<p>Railway links to cities in Poland are offered by several companies. In our province, it’s Koleje Śląskie [Silesian Railways]. To Kraków (located in the Lesser Poland Province) you can go by the POLREGIO train, while the long-distance and international connections belong to PKP Intercity.<br>Don’t panic! You’ll find all of the connections at <a href="http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en">http://rozklad.pkp.pl/en</a> and it provides all the necessary information about the searched train ride. The service is also available in English, German, and Russian. <br>Are you ready to go?</p>



<p>It’s hard to miss the Katowice Railway Station, as it’s located right in the city center, near the marketplace. You can reach it from the Lecha i Marii Kaczyńskich Square (former Szewczyka Square), Kościuszki Street, and 3 Maja Street – directly or through the Galeria Katowicka.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="3562" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3562" class="wp-image-3562" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1-340x226.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-Dworzec-PKP-1-625x416.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>In 2012, a major renovation was completed. The main hall and ticket offices are open 24/7. What’s important: PKP Intercity and Koleje Śląskie have separate ticket offices. The travel information office is open from 7 am to 9 pm.</p>

<h2><strong>Discover the Silesian Province</strong></h2>



<p>Cities in our region are ideal destinations to visit on your day off. Check the timetable, buy a ticket, hop on the train, and in less than an hour you’re there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regional Koleje Śląskie railway company offers direct train connections on more than ten routes and the detailed map is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.kolejeslaskie.com/en/timetable/routes-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>The gems of our region are especially worth visiting on weekends and on holidays. With the SilesiaWeekend campaign, during the weekends prices of tickets are discounted (15% off for a one-way ticket and 20% off for a round-trip). You can buy them in the Koleje Śląskie ticket offices, in ticket machine or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://www.kolejeslaskie.com/en/buy_ticket/by-internet/search-and-buy-a-ticket/" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" data-id="3565" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3565" class="wp-image-3565" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-340x226.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pociągiem-1.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>The cities we recommend choosing for a visit first are the small, but charming <strong>Pszczyna,</strong> with its little marketplace, beautiful palace, and expansive park (30+ minutes) and <strong>Bielsko-Biała</strong>,<strong> </strong>where you can roam the picturesque streets of the old town (1 hour away).</p>



<p>Just as worth visiting are <strong>Gliwice</strong>, <strong>Tychy</strong>,<strong> Zabrze, </strong>and<strong> Bytom.</strong> The ride will take less than 30 minutes and you’ll find perfect places to visit on your trip regardless of the weather or season.

<p>What’s surely attractive about Silesia is how close it is to the mountains.&nbsp;You can get from Katowice city center to <strong>Ustroń</strong> in less than 2 hours by train, and 30 minutes later you can get off in <strong>Wisła</strong>. The city of <strong>Żywiec</strong> (especially tempting in the summer) is available by train in 90 minutes. Whether you’re a fan of winter sports or prefer summer hikes, the Beskidy Mountains have a lot to offer. You can find a few inspirations for this skiing season in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/ski-resorts-in-silesia/" target="_blank">this</a> post.</p>



<h2><strong>Go See Poland</strong></h2>



<p>Do you have a couple of days off or nothing to do this weekend? Those are perfect opportunities to go a bit further and visit some of the most popular Polish cities. Tickets for domestic train trips are available from the PKP Intercity ticket offices or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank">online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How about visiting beautiful <strong>Kraków</strong>? The POLREGIO train will take you to Kraków Główny [Kraków Central Station] in about 2 hours. It seems a lot for a mere 80 kilometers ride, but you can take a nap, read a book or even watch a movie. A one-way ticket costs 13 PLN.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-682x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="3568" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3568" class="wp-image-3568" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-153x230.jpg 153w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-27x40.jpg 27w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1-277x416.jpg 277w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-dworzec-PKP-peron-1.jpg 888w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="3569" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3569" class="wp-image-3569" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1-340x226.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katowice-pendolino-1-625x416.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Although the distance to <strong>Wrocław </strong>is 100 km longer, you’ll get there in less than 2,5 hours. A direct connection is offered by PKP Intercity and a 2nd class ticket costs about 33 PLN.</p>



<p>A trip to <strong>Warsaw</strong> – depending on the type of train you take – will take from over 2 up to almost 4 hours. The prices of tickets also vary. The fast Pendolino train booked 30 days in advance (as early as you can) costs 49 PLN. A ticket bought one day in advance will cost 140–150 PLN. If you can plan ahead, make sure you do. You’ll save time and money.</p>



<p>How about the seaside? In under 6 hours? You hop on the train after lunch on Friday and you arrive in <strong>Gdańsk</strong> for dinner. The entire weekend in Trójmiasto [Tri-Cities] is yours. It’s best to visit the Baltic Sea out of season and walk the nearly-empty beach in <strong>Gdynia</strong> Orłowo or enjoy the crowd-free <strong>Sopot</strong>. Booked in advance, a one-way 2nd class seat costs 132 PLN. Beautiful Gdańsk is surely worth the price and the trip.</p>



<h2><strong>See a Piece of Europe</strong></h2>



<p>Katowice is also a great starting point to take trips abroad. You can go directly to five European capitals (six, including Warsaw, as we mentioned before).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" data-id="3570" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3570" class="wp-image-3570" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-340x226.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/do-Katowic-pociągiem-1.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Let’s begin the European jaunt with <strong>Prague</strong>. You’ll reach the capital of the Czech Republic in under 6 hours. There are three fast links during the day: 8:17 am, 11:52 am and 4:18 pm. You can also depart from Katowice a few minutes past midnight. This train ride will take almost 8 hours, but if you can sleep on the train, you’ll find yourself in Prague in time for an early breakfast. A one-way ticket starts at 15€.<br>You can also get to Prague by Chech Leo Express trains. All useful information and railway link can be found <a href="https://www.leoexpress.com/en/where-we-go/line-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="on their website (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">on their website</a>. </p>



<p>Another capital totally worth visiting is <strong>Vienna</strong>. The number of connections a day: 4. Travel time: under 5 hours. Like Prague, fans of night travel can take the train from Katowice right after midnight. It takes a bit longer than a day ride (almost 7 hours), but it’s cheaper as well (from 9€ one way).</p>



<p>The distance from Katowice to <strong>Berlin</strong> is similar to going to the Polish seaside, but the train takes a little longer (7.5 hours). It goes at night and fortunately, only in sleepers. You need to turn up at Katowice Railway Station at 2:14 am sharp, to wake up at the Berlin Hauptbahnhof at 9:48 am. A one-way 2nd class ticket starts at 15€.</p>

<p>What about a trip to Slovakia? <strong>Bratislava</strong> isn’t as popular as other European destinations. It’s a shame – the city is worth a weekend visit, even more so because you can get there in about 5 hours. The fastest train leaves the Katowice station at 11:58 am and arrives in at Bratislava 4:50 pm.&nbsp;You can also choose the night connection. Price? From 19€ one way.</p>



<p><strong>Budapest</strong> in Hungary is the furthest European capital with a direct connection from Katowice, however, the train takes longer, 8,5 hours. It’s the same Intercity Chopin, which departs for Prague, Vienna, and Bratislava 7 minutes past midnight. The price, just like in the case of Prague, starts with a 19€ promotional price.</p>



<p>The timetable is available at the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.intercity.pl/en/" target="_blank"> PKP Intercity</a> website. Tickets for international trains can only be bought in ticket offices at the station, but up to&nbsp;60 days in advance. In order to find the promotional prices given above, think of booking well in advance. Isn’t it the right time to plan a few spring weekends? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Have a nice trip!</p>

<p><strong>It’s worth going skiing in both the Alps and&#8230; in Silesia! Regardless of whether you’re making your first runs on the slopes or if your skiing passion has been with you for years, it’s worth taking a closer look at the ski resorts in our region. We chose the 9 most interesting points on the Silesian winter sports map.</strong></p>



<p>The season for white madness is gaining momentum and with it the growing interest in ski resorts. Novices are looking for equipment rentals and classes with an instructor, and experienced enthusiasts &#8211; facilities that meet their expectations. Experienced skiers and snowboarders have their favorite places in the Alps or in the Bethany Mountains (the Spanish Sierra Nevada is still gaining popularity). Yet, they’re also interested in Polish ski resorts. The resorts located in Silesia are exciting. Investment projects, numerous modernizations and expansions are a sign of considerable development in the area of ​​winter sports in our region. Just grab your winter gear and go!<br></p>



<h2>SZCZYRK</h2>



<h2>Beskid Sport Arena</h2>



<p>In Szczyrk, and more specifically in the picturesque Bila Valley, you’ll find the modern Beskid Sport Arena. This winter season, 2019/2020, the resort offers 4 ski runs with a total length of 3.2 km and an area of ​​8 ha. Particularly noteworthy is the flagship blue trail with a length of 1200 m. Its attraction is a 50-meter tunnel that allows for a collision-free passage under slalom slope No. 3. All runs are equipped with modern LED lighting, which allows for pleasant and utterly safe skiing after dark.</p>



<p>The primary transport device of the resort is the Beskid Chairlift, a six-seater lift equipped with windshields. Guests of the resort can use 5 parking lots with a total capacity of 400 cars and 5 buses and parking is free. The Beskid Sport Arena ski resort participates in the Szczyrkowski Wspólny Skipass program, which connects up to 3 of the largest ski resorts in Szczyrk: the Beskid Sport Arena, Centralny Ośrodek Sportu, and Szczyrk Mountain Resort. Free shuttle buses run between the resorts during the high season. The resort also offers rentals and you’ll find ski and snowboard equipment from reputable companies. In addition to the rentals, the resort also has a ski school, bicycle rentals, and the &#8220;BACHRATA&#8221; restaurant.</p>

<p>We’ll stay in Szczyrk, but we’ll move to the Szczyrk Mountain Resort, which is one of the largest ski resorts in Poland. This gem is located on the slopes of Małe Skrzyczne (1211 m a.s.l.) and Wierch Pośredni (1000 m a.s.l.) For years the resort has been considered an excellent destination for tourists from the Silesian and Lesser Poland provinces. It was also great option for skiing enthusiasts from the Czech Republic or Slovakia. The resort offers over 22 km of varied downhill runs (including 5 km of illuminated runs). Thanks to the cooperation with Centralny Ośrodek Sportu and Beskid Sport Arena, since the 2017 season you can use a joint ski pass covering up to 40 km of trails.</p>



<p>Currently, the Szczyrk Mountain Resort has completed the first stage of renovation. Thanks to this you can use the 10-seater gondola lift and two 6-seater chairlifts since the 2017 season. In the 2018 season another 6-seater chairlift for Zbójnicka Kopa was added, which is great for beginners. Last year the longest gondola ride in Szczyrk starts with a picturesque passage to Zbójnicka Kopa and the yellow walking trail. In the resort you’ll find the largest ski and snowboard school in Szczyrk, equipment rentals and ski schools covering up to 1000 m2 of a separate training zones, in which everyone, regardless of age, can make their first runs.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of talk about Istebna&#8217;s unique microclimate and if you believe them, there are good skiing conditions from November to April. And all thanks to the temperature, which in Istebna is usually a few degrees lower than in neighboring towns. At the Złoty Groń Ski Resort, you have very well prepared and extensive runs of varying difficulty. Here you’ll find a 6-person chairlift with a length of 800 m, the capacity of 2550 people / h and a speed of 5 m / s as well as a T-bar lift with a length of 290 m and a capacity of 900 people / h. </p>



<p>More advanced skiers can use the training route with electronic time measurement. The routes are illuminated and equipped with a modern snowmaking system. The resort also offers a ski school, a snowboard school, a rental shop, 4 food outlets, and free parking. The youngest winter sports enthusiasts can use the children&#8217;s area with a carousel and a ski lift.</p>

Do you know how to spend an exciting time outside Katowice when the weather is terrible and foggy? The answer is in fascinating museums and attractions in Silesia. Below you will find six suggestions for those rainy days. From the centre of our metropolitan area you can reach them by car in 30-45 minutes.</strong></p>



<h2>The<strong> </strong>City Palm House in Gliwice [Palmiarnia]</h2>

Discover giant palm trees, sun-loving flowers, tropical fruits like lemons, oranges, pomegranates, and avocado, plus tropical birds, turtles, lizards, chameleons, desert squirrels, and insects.

<h2>The Fire Museum &#8211; Żory</h2>



<p>If, after the Gliwice tropics, you still experience a lack of heat, we invite you to the city of Żory. There’s an unusual interactive museum dedicated to one of the five elements &#8211; fire. Why such an attraction right here? Well, during its several hundred years of existence, the city burned down dozens of times. To commemorate one of the most massive fires that took place in 1702, there’s even a Fire Festival celebrated here.</p>

<h2>The Museum of Silesian Uprisings &#8211; Świętochłowice</h2>



<p>Over the centuries Silesia was inhabited by Poles, Germans, and Czechs. The fluid borders in the region meant that for hundreds of years the influences and interests of all three nations mixed because of the changing borders and various times parts of Silesia belonged to different countries. The most significant border changes in the 20th century took place after the end of World War I, when the Silesian Uprisings took place in Silesia, i.e. three armed insurrections of Poles residing here against the German state (1919-1921). The insurgents at that time fought for Silesia to join the newly reborn&nbsp; Poland (1919).</p>

<h2>The Guido Mine and The Queen Louise Adit &#8211; Zabrze</h2>



<p>Silesia has long been associated with coal mining. In the past, almost every city in the region had one or even several coal mines.

These are attractions unique in a global scale that will allow you to feel the hardships of mining work and discover the historical heritage of this region.</p>

<p>The open-air museums are located at the original nineteenth-century mines. They are situated less than 2 kilometers from each other and give many reasons to visit. The main ones? A ride down in the mine shaft elevator over 300 meters underground. Venture among the over 200-year-old historical tunnels. Ride by boat on one of the longest underground tunnels in Europe (1100 meters). Travel on a suspended mine train, and if that isn’t enough &#8211; an exceptional beer can be enjoyed in the deepest pub on the continent!</p>

<h2>The Black Trout Adit and The Silver Museum &#8211; Tarnowskie Góry&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Zabrze isn’t the only city in Silesia where you can go underground and see what the work of miners looked like in the past. Equally interesting attractions, included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, are in Tarnowskie Góry. The 18th-century tunnels are a remnant of the &#8220;Fryderyk&#8221; mine, where silver ore was mined. In the Black Trout Adit, an underground boat ride awaits you on a 600-meter route connecting two mine shafts. In the Historic Silver Mine, a journey through the old tunnels from the 18th and 19th centuries can be enjoyed. During the 1.5 km route, we’ll get to know former jobs, tools, and work methods of the miners. The route is enriched with audiovisual effects that allow you to feel the real atmosphere of those times. The museum also has an exciting multimedia exhibition about the geology and history of these attractions, and is next to the Steam Engine Museum.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Princely Brewery &#8211; Tychy</h2>



<p>Although we’ve already offered you one beer during the tour, in the end, we invite you for one more. Tychy is a place that’s probably known to every adult Pole. It’s here that the headquarters of the company is located, which for many years created the brand that is synonymous with Polish beer &#8211; Tyskie. Tourists can visit both the historic brewery, which has been brewing beer for four centuries, and the unique museum with a collection of beer exhibits, mugs, mug coasters, and barrels from around the world. The crowning event of the visit is the tasting of their 14-day Tyskie Gronie in an historic pub. It’s worth considering using public transport. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong>The spring and summer period is a perfect time to get to know the greener side of Silesia and take a walk or go for a bike ride around one of the unique areas that our region abounds with. Today we would like to show you 6 interesting places around Katowice, which will enchant everyone with their unique natural beauty. Welcome to Pszczyna, Bytom, and Mikołów. You can reach all these places from Katowice in 30-60 minutes by public transport or by car. Well, unless you hop on your bike from the city center&#8230;</strong></p>



<h2>Cycling Route Katowice &#8211; Pszczyna: It’s Good to go Cycling in the Woods</h2>



<p>Although reaching a destination is vital, sometimes the road that leads to it is an attraction in itself. This will be the case if you hop on your two wheels and head south. Katowice is a city designed for cyclists, and the bike route to Pszczyna is a real classic. Importantly, the ride can start in the very center of Katowice, as the route starts in the Park Powstańców. This is where you’ll find the red markings of the trail that leads you directly to the village, called by some, the Pearl of Upper Silesia. </p>



<p>The route is about 50 kilometers long, but you don&#8217;t have to cycle without stopping. Moreover, it would be difficult considering the number of attractive stopovers that encourage you to take a break on your way. This bike path, for instance, goes through the recreational area of&nbsp; Trzy Stawy (“Three Ponds”), the reserve of &#8220;Kłodnica Springs&#8221;&nbsp; close to Lake Paprocany near Tychy and crosses the charming Kobiórskie forest. But, the biggest attractions are probably at the end of this fascinating route, which will be described further below.</p>

<h2>Palace Park in Pszczyna: A Walk with History in the Background</h2>



<p>Featured at the beginning, the Red Bicycle Trail from Katowice will also lead you to the walls of the historic palace in Pszczyna (but you can also reach this place driving or using public transport). Surrounded by greenery, this stately building has a long and beautiful history. Erected in the 11th or 12th century and repeatedly rebuilt, today it is regarded as a Neo-baroque gem. Now, this historic interior has been turned into a museum.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we’ll be more interested in its enchanting surroundings. Within this 156 hectare area,&nbsp;there is a beautiful park, arranged in the 2nd half of the 19th century in British style. It means that its appearance refers to the landscapes present in nature. For many years this complex has been enticing walkers with alleys interlacing picturesque lakes and cozy bridges thrown over lazily flowing rivers.</p>



<p>Located on the Islet in the Palace Park (Park Palacowy) the Daisy Tea Room has been attracting crowds of tourists recently. There you’ll find a rich selection of teas, lemonades, coffees, and delicious cakes and desserts. Strongly recommended after an intense walk or bike ride!</p>

<h2>Zagroda Żubrów (Bison Farm) in Pszczyna: King of the Forest in the City Center</h2>



<p>Pszczyna is a place recommended for a little longer stay. In addition to the interesting market square, it prides itself on the most powerful European mammal, the bison. Not so long ago these dignified animals were on the verge of extinction. Today you can meet them in a specially dedicated part of the park called the &#8220;Bison Farm&#8221;.</p>



<p>Nature lovers can preview the habits of these giant mammals using a convenient observation platform. You can also brush up on your knowledge of nature. There is a movie portraying this interesting animal, which can be watched in a small cinema room next door.</p>



<p>Although the bison is the real king of the park, it’s also accompanied by other animals, such as mouflons, deer, does, fallow deer, and several species of birds. It’s virtually a ZOO!</p>

<h2>Silesian Botanical Garden: Captivating Plants and an Extensive Panorama</h2>



<p>Fiołkowa Góra (Violet Mountain) is an inconspicuous hill located within the borders of Mikołów. Certainly, nobody would have heard of it if it hadn&#8217;t been for the so-called ‘natural inventory’ in 1996. It was demonstrated that the slopes of that relatively low hill and adjacent region with the two streams Promny and Jasienica were abundant with precious plant species. It was decided that good use should be made of those fallow lands taking into account their natural potential. Today Fiołkowa Góra is a bustling place. There’s the unique Silesian Botanical Garden, which is frequently visited by many, not only by Mikołów residents. </p>



<p>In numerous flower beds and squares grow various plants, eye-catching, and delighting us with their scents. Visitors can admire the exhibitions of nature photos whilst strolling around the area. A dense network of alleys, numerous benches, pleasant cafés, magnificent panoramas, and the observation tower (reaching as far as the Beskid mountains)&nbsp; &#8211; these attractions will definitely convince you to head for Mikołów on a nice and warm weekend.</p>

<h2>Segiet Reserve: UNESCO &#8211; A Primeval Forest</h2>



<p>Bytom is one of the oldest towns in Silesia, known for its long-standing mining traditions dating back to the Middle Ages. However, the city’s famous not only for its rich history but, also for the unique Silesian nature, whose extraordinary character was internationally recognized when this reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Reserve list. </p>



<p>If you want to see the original beech forest once growing in the region of Silesia, you must go to Segiet for a walk or a bike ride. Located in the area of abandoned mines, the reserve is located on the slopes of Srebrna Gora (347 m above sea level). Every nature lover will be enthralled with it. In the vicinity of the city, you’ll find enormous majestic beech trees 130-150 years old and rich fauna abundant with amphibians, reptiles, and birds. There’s a trail named &#8220;Las Segiecki&#8221; in the reserve,&nbsp; which facilitates moving around this extraordinary place.</p>

Enter Blachówka street, at the end of which there is a small car park. It is about 40 min from Katowice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Silesian Railways: head for Tarnowskie Góry (approx. 50 min, cost 4 PLN), then take&nbsp; 289 bus.

<h2>The Dolomites (Dolomity), Sports Valley (Sportowa Dolina) and Blachówka</h2>



<p>The commercial mining in the area of Bytom and Tarnowskie Góry can be specifically seen in the area of Blachówka quarry, adjacent to the nature reserve Segiet. When after many centuries of mining, commercial mining ended in 1990 and the land was eventually returned to nature. A several dozen &#8211; meter long slope of Triassic deposits and the interior of the valley (known to locals as ‘Great Canyon’ ),&nbsp;with trees and shrubs growing again, create an extraordinary atmosphere and make this place an attractive recreational area.</p>



<p>Today Blachówka is one of the most favorite places for walking and cycling, not only for Bytom residents but also for the inhabitants of&nbsp;all of Silesia. The mountain atmosphere in the heart of the Silesian metropolitan area is emphasized by the year-round sports facility built near the quarry-the Dolomites Sports Valley, where in winter you can go skiing and snowboarding. There is also a restaurant there with an interesting view of the valley, open all year round.</p>

<p>What exactly distinguishes this reservoir from others in the area? It’s how perfectly Paprocany’s nature harmonizes with modern architectural forms.

People seeking relaxation can sit back on somewhat futuristic benches with sunshades or lie in comfortable hammocks integrated into the structure of the promenade. The youngest will be happy to avail of the offer of Poland&#8217;s first water playground, and lovers of evening walks will feast their eyes on a multi-colored performance after dark by beautifully lit fountains.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>#2 Sosnowiec Wake Zone Stawiki: emotions on a wave</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of water activities, head towards Sosnowiec. The Wake Zone Stawiki park should be on the bucket list of people on a wave, who are looking for refreshment in summer. In 2013, a real Wake Park was opened in the water area near Stadion Ludowy. From that moment, the building was systematically retrofitted. Today, thrill seekers and enthusiasts of water attractions have at their fingertips a large wakeboard lift and a giant obstacle course created from inflatable forms floating on the water. Now, after a long and emotional struggle, visitors coming to Sosnowiec can finally sit in one of the gastronomic facilities&nbsp; to partake of the nutritious delicacies served there.</p>

<h2>#3 Dąbrowa Górnicza: Biała Przemsza gorge: a favorite place for canoeists</h2>



<p>Although it is not a typical highland river, it displays certain mountain river characteristics as it flows quite fast for a lowland stream. The Biała Przemsza river, which is quite an inconspicuous river flowing through towns such as Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, Mysłowice, and Jaworzno, used to share its riverbed with the Czarna Przemsza river and the Przemsza river, which together once marked the so-called Triangle of Three Emperors. We’re not going to elaborate on that, though, as this is a topic for history enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Today the Biała Przemsza appears mainly as a place created for leisure activity, for example canoeing! Enthusiasts of this sport can be found in different parts of the less than 64-kilometer-long watercourse, but the most popular is the gorge of the Biała Przemsza in Dąbrowa Górnicza -Kradzionów. At that point, the river is radically changing: it becomes wider and deeper, turns sharply and begins to meander. This sudden metamorphosis gives it charm and attracts paddling enthusiasts. If you are a canoeist, you will definitely be loving it!</p>



<p><strong>Rafting on the White Przemsza River</strong>: prices from 70 PLN<br><strong>Access:</strong> To Sławków, where most of the rafting starts, about a 30 minute drive by car from the center of Katowice. <br><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://przemsza.pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://przemsza.pl/ (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)">https://przemsza.pl/</a><br></p>



<h2>#4 Pogoria: everyone gets&nbsp; active</h2>



<p>Bicycling, rollerblading, Nordic walking, kayaking, jet skiing, sail boating, and many other outdoor activities. Pogoria is a complex of four water reservoirs formed in Dąbrowa Górnicza in the abandoned sand pits where sand used to be extracted&nbsp; for the surrounding mines. It’s a real enclave of relaxation and a real green gem in the center of the metropolitan area. The ponds, which have a post-industrial origin, today form a protected landscape area and attract amateurs of outdoor activities from all over the region.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Croatia&#8221; is a place specially arranged for you to spend a pleasant time. The wooden footbridges, the pier, the gazebo, and the vantage points are pleasant places to relax. Furthermore, they make a stylish background for pictures. Thanks to the convenient cycling paths, the lakes have become a popular destination for cyclists, and the underwater world tempts diving fans.&nbsp; The local tourist infrastructure is new, but it’s not much older than&#8230; the lakes themselves. They were created completely by chance. The owners of the quarries did not pay their electric bills. When the electric company cut off the power, the pump ceased to work. It only took a few dozen hours for the quarries to turn into picturesque ponds.</p>



<p><strong>Free admission</strong><br><strong>Directions:</strong> Car approx. 30 min, Polish railways approx. 30 min. (Price from 5 zł),&nbsp; get off at Jaworzno Szczakowa station and  get on 314 bus , after 5 minutes get off at the stop at the Pieska Dive centre, and it takes just 15 minutes to get to the quarry on foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The heart of Upper Silesia is teeming with street art thanks to the initiative that has been changing the city space for 8 years. The Katowice Street Art Urban Sound Festival 2019 is the continuation of the legendary Katowice Street Art Festival. Łukasz Kałębasiak, the co-founder of the festival and the spokesperson for the <em>Krystyna Bochenek Institution of Culture: Katowice – the City of Gardens</em> tells us about the most interesting murals, extreme emotions, big names and the development of street art in Silesia. </strong></p>



<p><strong>How have the 8 years of the festival-related artistic activities changed the city? </strong><br></p>



<p>Our festival was first held under the name of Katowice Street Art Festival, which was used for the first few editions. This event has indeed strongly changed the cityscape. One of the first murals created in Katowice that has been with us so far was created in 2010 as part of the Off Festival. <strong><em>Dawno w mieście nie byłem</em></strong> by Marcin Maciejowski is one of the most iconic works. When we started the first edition of the KSAF, Maciejowski’s work was the last item on the street art list. That is why the first edition of the Katowice Street Art Festival in 2011 was a real blast. It has left behind some excellent works that we can still admire.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1274" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0642-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Dawno w mieście nie byłem</em> by <strong>Marcin Maciejowski</strong><br>(11 Warszawska Street )</figcaption></figure>



<p>The so-called <strong><em>Hen</em></strong> by the Spanish artist <strong>Aryz</strong> is the street art icon in Katowice, and it still can be seen at the back of St Mary&#8217;s Street. We call it the hen because it presents a decomposing hen laying an egg (immediately in the ‘sunny-side-up’ version). Since 2011, we have managed to enrich the city landscape with great projects, of which about 20 exist so far. Thanks to subsequent editions, Katowice is on the list of street arts in Poland reaching the summit next to cities such as Gdańsk and Łódź. In the south of Poland, we are definitely one of the best street art galleries.</p>



<p><strong>In addition to artistic changes in the urban space has street art awareness among the residents and visitors evolved?</strong></p>

<p>Over the years of the festival&#8217;s existence, we have managed to get the Katowice people familiar with street art. And we have been doing it gradually and intentionally. First, we invited artists who created more approachable works, somehow decorative, to raise the bar over time. With subsequent editions in Katowice, we have hosted more and more artists touching on important topics, more and more abstract and sharp in their expression. If Aryz is at one pole, at the opposite end of this scale appears <strong>Eltono</strong>, who has left an extreme emotion-evoking mural in the underground passage at Damrota Street.</p>



<p>Eltono&#8217;s work can be viewed as a cave painting depicting two tribes fighting with each other. The mural is very sharp, aggressive, speaks of violence in contemporary society, which we haven’t grown out of yet. After the completion of the works very critical voices appeared. Many people have said that the painting was scary, aggressive and it should not be found in a public space. And this perfectly demonstrates the power of this type of work.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1281" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0810-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><strong>Eltono&#8217;s </strong>mural <br>(Underpass at Damrota Street) <br></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I remember one edition of the festival, probably from 2012, when two diggers covered in yarn appeared in front of Spodek. They were made by Agata Oleksiak (Olek), an artist globally known for knitting street art (so-called knitting) and very loud exhibits. One of them was the Wall Street Charging Bull dressed in a pink knitted outfit. A few years ago works by such artists as Mariusz Waras (M CITY), ESCIF or Tellas appeared in the Katowice area. What causes the city to attract the legends of street art so much?</strong></p>



<p>In the beginning, the artists approached the festival with some caution, as it is with any budding initiative. However, I think that after the first edition of festival a good opinion about Katowice has spread. People who organize this festival are 100% involved in it and artists are offered good working conditions, which is why in the subsequent editions we have attracted big and serious names. The result of this was the creation of such works as <strong><em>The switch</em></strong> by <strong>ESCIF</strong> on Mikusiński street, which next to the Aryz&#8217;s <em>Hen</em> is probably the second most iconic work in the whole gallery of the Katowice street art.<br></p>



<p>A few years ago a reproduction of <em>The switch</em> appeared on the cover of one of the albums of the world’s street art. Today a book with the Katowice mural on its cover can be found on the shelves of the largest contemporary art bookshops in the world. We also had a hilarious case. A man who lives in the United States saw a photo of this mural somewhere. He contacted us asking for a photo of this work. We sent him the photo in high resolution, and he &#8211; as part of the rematch &#8211; sent us a photo of <em>The switch </em>hanging above the fireplace in his American home.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1283" width="456" height="683" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-200x300.jpg 200w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-153x230.jpg 153w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-27x40.jpg 27w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828-277x416.jpg 277w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0828.jpg 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></a><figcaption><em>The switch</em> by <strong>ESCIF</strong><br>(5 Mikusińskiego Street)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Post-industrial spaces are a real paradise for street artists. What interesting places, apart from the walls of apartment houses, have been decorated by the festival creators over the years?</strong><br></p>



<p>Indeed, the post-industrial character of Katowice allows for much in the field of street art. As the city is not full to the brim with monuments, it was easier for artists to enter the city center. We did not have to resort to concrete estates, and some very interesting works are still in the very center. I particularly appreciate those works that originated in the more traditional districts of Katowice, among old apartment houses and synagogues in Załęże or in Szopienice. These works best fit in there. Street art is the perfect counterweight to the architectural austerity of these areas of the city.<br></p>



<p><strong>Which mural created as part of the festival is the closest to you?</strong><br></p>



<p>One of my favorite works is <strong><em>Made you look</em></strong> by a British artist<strong> Mobstr</strong>. The mural guides our eyes from the ground level through the entire height of the wall of the apartment house, all the way to the top, where we find an ambiguous inscription <em>Made you look,</em> which can be explained as ‘I made you look’, ‘I provoked you’. And that&#8217;s how street artworks. It is provocation to look and think.<br></p>



<p><strong>A lot of materials devoted to street art are limited to providing a list of murals with addresses and necessary information about their creators. And yet, in street art the most interesting thing is a spontaneous and completely unexpected encounter with an idea that provokes questions. A great example of such a work is <em>Daddy don’t cry </em>made by Łukasz Surowiec in 2015. Do people ask or enter into dialogue with street art?</strong><br></p>



<p>The dialogue with the mural takes place in the mind of each recipient. Following the artist’s intention, we tried not to add any text to the murals, especially a description on the mural or next to it. The only description is the one relating to Aryz&#8217;s work, because it is the work that was created as part of the first edition of the festival. All other murals stand-alone, face to face with the audience, space, and the street. And they are unsaid, unanswered. If a mural such as <strong><em>Daddy don’t cry</em></strong> triggers a media reaction, it will be an automatic answer. The work of <strong>Łukasz Surowiec</strong> is strictly narrative with a very strong history behind it. I think that everyone remembers the times of the miners&#8217; strike and one of the important moments in the transformation of Upper Silesia, to which the mural refers. <br></p>

<p>The same goes for educational works. We also try to avoid explaining them. A good example is the mural of <strong><em>Wojciech Korfanty</em></strong> created last year to mark the hundredth anniversary of the restoration of Poland’s independence. No information attached. You can guess who is depicted there, or you can look for information about it. We leave the murals unspoken because this is also the role of street art not to give easy solutions and simple answers. It is geared to inspire you to search, to get active.<br></p>

<p><strong>If you were to point out five Katowice murals with the most interesting ideas and stories behind them, which ones would you choose?</strong><br></p>



<p>Firstly, <strong><em>The Switch</em></strong> by <strong>ESCIF</strong> as the one that was the most successful. This is not the only reason why I think about it. This is one of the most ambiguous murals.<br></p>



<p>The second one is the mural <strong><em>Made you look</em></strong> created by <strong>Mobstr</strong>. It is enigmatic, and this is an element that I value the most in street art.<br></p>



<p>The third one is, thankfully, the still-functioning mural <strong><em>THINK</em></strong> by <strong>Spy</strong>, created at a great point, as the house between Szopienice and Janów is visible from various places. The work itself is a powerful appeal to use your own mind despite the current trends.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1277" width="395" height="592" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-200x300.jpg 200w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-153x230.jpg 153w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-27x40.jpg 27w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747-277x416.jpg 277w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0747.jpg 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></a><figcaption><em>Made you look</em> by <strong>Mobstr</strong><br>(3 Lelewela Street, Załęże)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The fourth mural is <strong><em>Statistic</em></strong> by <strong>Sasha Kurmaz</strong> from Kiev. It is located between Załęska Hałda and Ligota. This is a purely abstract mural, almost like Mondrian’s, and is actually a visualization of a survey conducted by the artist. During the time of the fiery Ukrainian-Russian conflict, Kurmaz asked the inhabitants of Katowice about their attitude towards these events and visualized the results of their research in the form of a mural. In fact, it is a large ‘Excel -type’ pie chart, only transferred onto a wall of an apartment house.<br></p>



<p>And finally, the fifth work. <strong><em>DO NOT THINK</em></strong> by <strong>Peter Fuss</strong> is the most politically powerful mural that can be found in Katowice. It is also a very contrary mural that calls on you to stop thinking, focus on paying taxes and vote for those you have to vote for. It is a strong political and anti-system work. As part of a festival organized by a public institution, we managed to create a socially-oriented mural, often reproduced and interpreted as a voice of protest.<br></p>



<p><strong>Coming back to the festival, apart from the murals being created, the event from the beginning is a mix of various artistic, musical and sporting events. Each edition brings new surprises. How will it be this year?</strong><br></p>



<p>We will soon reveal more about how Katowice Street Art will look this year. And the festival is actually an event that has been evolving almost from the very beginning. After many editions focusing on murals, still within the framework of the Katowice Street Art Festival, we began to shift towards social activities and creation of objects in a public space.<br></p>

<p>The last two editions run by Matylda Sałajewska under <em>Katowice Street Art AiR,</em> or <em>Arts in Residence</em>, have implemented the concept of artist residencies. The artists were invited for a longer stay in Katowice so that they could get to know the city better. They chose the subject and space in which they would like to create by themselves. Importantly, all ideas were born here, in Katowice. The idea of ​​artist residencies is already behind us, we have ticked it off as a fulfilled demand and a successful experiment. Now we are starting to operate with a completely new Urban Sound formula, which will combine street art with the space of sounds. Sound installations will be prepared by excellent artists. Since 2015, Katowice has been a UNESCO Creative City in the field of music. Therefore, we wanted to combine these two areas, which is not difficult. After all, music and street art are intertwined, and contemporary street artists are eager to enter the musical space. You just have to match them well and let them create.<br></p>

<p><strong>There are a lot of picturesque places, eye-catching monuments and modern museums in Poland. Kraków, Gdańsk, Wrocław and Warsaw have already entered Lonely Planet guidebooks for good, and are a must-see on every tourist&#8217;s</strong><strong> itinerary. Until recently the capital of Upper Silesia was nowhere to be found there. </strong><strong>Today, however, Katowice is an example of a successful </strong><strong>urban transformation, and the city&#8217;s vibrant attractions </strong><strong>grab the attention of an increasing number of</strong><strong> tourists.</strong><br></p>



<p>What makes Katowice stand out so much from other Polish cities? There is no medieval market, tenement houses or extensive river boulevards there, unlike in any other Polish cities. So, why do more and more people perceive Katowice as a new center of Polish culture, architecture and urban life? After all, a few years ago Katowice was associated mainly with coal and heavy industry, and tourists practically did not come there. The answer is as simple as it is complex: change &#8211; this is why the city arouses curiosity and has so much to offer.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-992" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4791-1.jpg 1229w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Spodek</figcaption></figure>



<p>Probably nowhere else in Poland has it been possible to rebuild the city center so thoroughly, effectively and fast (just in 10 years) and embed in its structure new points recognizable in the whole country. At the same time, the past of Katowice and its region has not been forgotten; post-industrial objects have been revitalized and new applications for them have been found. Dozens of new gastronomic and cultural spots have sprung up in the city, and the already recognized festivals have found a permanent place there: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://katowicestreetartair.pl/" target="_blank">Katowice Street Art AiR</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://festiwalnowamuzyka.pl/en/" target="_blank">Tauron Nowa Muzyka</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://off-festival.pl/en/" target="_blank">OFF Festival</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://jazzartfestival.eu/en" target="_blank">Jazz Art Festival</a>. <br></p>



<p><strong>So let&#8217;s take a look at the 9 places that you must visit in Katowice!</strong></p>



<h2>#1 Nikiszowiec &#8211; the symbol of the city’s old history</h2>



<p>Characteristic brick, red window borders, flower mosaics on the walls, attractive architectural details &#8211; if we were to mention one place that is inevitably associated with the past of Katowice and the entire region, it would certainly be Nikiszowiec. This workers&#8217; housing estate, which was built for mine workers between 1908 and 1918 on the initiative of the mining and metallurgical company Georg von Giesches Erben, together with the nearby Giszowiec (also a must-see) is the best example of this type of architecture in Europe. It was designed as a self-sufficient housing estate offering workers all necessary facilities &#8211; such as shops, schools, inns, church, laundries or bread-baking ovens. Everything in a uniform but not boring architectural style.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-994" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4297-1.jpg 1229w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Nikiszowiec</figcaption></figure>



<p>Having been neglected for so many years, today’s Nikiszowiec finally becomes a real tourist gem, which regains its former splendor (it is even said to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list). Strolling around the local streets, looking at the local market or the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://www.mhk.katowice.pl/index.php/dla-zwiedzajacych/wystawy-stale/21-u-nos-w-doma-na-nikiszu" target="_blank"> City Ethnology Department of the Katowice Historical Museum</a>, where you can see the designs of contemporary apartments &#8211; you can feel the spirit of past times.<br></p>

<h2>Culture Zone: Silesian Museum, NOSPR, MCK, Spodek</h2>



<p>Even in the 1990s, in the place where there are currently three architecturally unique objects, coal was still mined. Today the area around the former &#8220;Katowice&#8221; mine is teeming with life and is the cultural and entertainment heart of the city attracting hundreds of visitors. It is a perfect example of making use of the post-industrial area and regaining urban space for residents.<br></p>



<h2><strong>#2 The New Silesian Museum</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1003" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4749-1.jpg 1229w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>The New Silesian Museum</figcaption></figure>



<p>The center of the former mine itself and the post-industrial buildings were used to build the new seat of the Silesian Museum. There we will find both the Gallery of Polish Art 1800-1945 with paintings by the eminent Polish painters such as Gierymski, Matejko or Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, and more modern art, after 1945, where you can see the works by Zdzisław Beksiński or Zbigniew Libera. The most impressive, however, seems to be the multimedia exhibition dedicated to the history of the region: &#8220;The Light of History. Upper Silesia Over the Centuries &#8220;, which starts with a passage through the real hall of the former Katowice mine. It is worth noting that most exhibition halls of the museum are located 13 meters underground, and the mine shaft itself was used as an observation deck, from which you could admire the panorama of Katowice. It&#8217;s best to visit the museum on Tuesday, which is a free admission day.<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time: </strong>approx. 3-5 hours, depending on the number of exhibitions you plan to visit.</li><li><strong>How to get there: </strong>from the Katowice area, you can get there by almost 30 bus and tram lines, the nearest stop is Katowice Strefa Kultury. The museum is closed every Monday.</li><li><strong>Where to eat: </strong>directly in the museum there is <strong>Moodro Restaurant and Moodro bistro &amp; cafe</strong>, in the break between visiting individual exhibitions, so you can go for coffee and dessert or even for an appetizing lunch.</li><li><strong>WWW:</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://muzeumslaskie.pl/en" target="_blank">https://muzeumslaskie.pl/en</a></li></ul>



<h2><strong>#3 NOSPR</strong></h2>

<p>The huge red lump of the Polish National Radio Orchestra refers to the previously mentioned Nikiszowiec. It&#8217;s impressive from the outside, but it&#8217;s just a prelude to what&#8217;s waiting for visitors inside. The hall, which can accommodate 1800 music lovers, literally takes your breath away and acoustics are considered to be one of the best in Europe &#8211; thanks to natural materials used for the interior design (mainly trees) and the painstaking work of Japanese engineers. Of course, NOSPR is best visited during one of the many concerts, because it is only then that it comes alive with the fullness of sounds.<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time:</strong> it&#8217;s best to attend one of the numerous concerts, tickets must be booked well in advance, though.</li><li><strong>How to get there: </strong> there are almost 30 bus and tram lines from the center of Katowice to the Zone of Culture. The nearest stop is Katowice Strefa Kultury NOSPR. A walk from the center will take a few minutes.</li><li><strong>Where to eat: </strong>meals served in the Cadenza restaurant are on the same level as the artistic achievements of the Polish Radio Orchestra. It is necessary to feel these aromatic notes.</li><li><strong>WWW:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://www.nospr.org.pl" target="_blank">http://</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="www.nospr.org.pl (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://www.nospr.org.pl/en/" target="_blank">www.nospr.org.pl/en</a></li></ul>



<h2><strong>#4 #5 International Congress Centre and Spodek</strong></h2>

<p>The structure of the last building, which fits squarely into the city panorama and perfectly contrasts with the well-deserved and recognizable Spodek, was, on the contrary, inspired by coal. Although the MCK (International Congress Centre) is not a building that can be regarded as a typical sightseeing object, its unique shape and green roof effect made it something more than an ordinary conference venue. Today the Green Valley (i.e. the name of the pass between the two parts of the building) is a place of rest and meetings in the very center of the metropolis. It is worth going for a walk to admire the shape of the famous Spodek from the terrace of the MCK leisure center, which after almost 50 years from its opening is still regarded as one of the most original buildings in the country. Both objects create a unique architectural space that reveals the new face of Katowice. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time:</strong> 0-60 min is enough to feel the atmosphere of this extraordinary architecture and take unique photos for Instagram;)</li><li><strong>How to get there:</strong> nearly 30 bus and tram lines from the center of Katowice, the nearest stop is Katowice Strefa Kultury. It&#8217;s best to take a walk there.</li><li>Where to eat: between the NOSPR and MCK there is ISTO restaurant that serves modern Polish cuisine.

<h2>#6 Valley of Three Ponds and Sztauwajery (Dolina Trzech Stawów i Sztauwajery) </h2>



<p>Talking about relaxing and lazing about, the best place is the Valley of Three Ponds. Sztauwajery is the Silesian name commonly used to describe the green area situated several minutes from the city center &#8211; It&#8217;s a perfect place for roller skating, renting a city bike or reading a book while sitting or lying on a blanket. There are many paths, a skatepark, several restaurants, and three extensive ponds, where you can chill out enjoying the peace and quiet. In the summer, it is the venue of the most recognizable Katowice music event &#8211; i.e. OFF Festival.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-1024x575.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1012" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-340x191.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-71x40.jpg 71w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1-740x416.jpg 740w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4588-1.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Sztauwajery</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time: </strong>how much do you think lazy time takes? In our opinion, 2-3 hours are perfect to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city &#8211; especially in warmer months.</li><li><strong>How to get here: </strong>bus lines 672, 674, 910 from the Katowice Dworzec station. A walk from the center takes several minutes.</li><li><strong>Where to eat:</strong> in the season, we strongly recommend relaxing at the <strong>Sztauwajery</strong> bistro container buildings.</li></ul>

<p>Although one of the largest municipal parks in Europe is not centrally located in Katowice but on its border with the city of Chorzów, this place must be visited.  Created in the 1950s in the post-industrial wasteland, the green area is twice as large as the famous Central Park in New York and four times larger than London Hyde Park. In season you can spend a whole day there, due to various attractions such as: Amusement Park, Planetarium, Zoological Garden, Rope Park, Skansen, Rosarium, the largest stadium in Silesia, narrow-gauge and cable railway, dozens of buffets, restaurants and pubs. Everyone will find something for themselves and will certainly call in again, not just once. <br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time:</strong> the park is a vast complex with many attractions. There you can spend from one hour up to the whole day, and you will certainly not be bored.</li><li><strong>How to get there:</strong> trams 6, 7, 11, 19 and 23; Bus lines: 6, 820, 830, 830N, 840, 840N.</li><li><strong>Where to eat:</strong> If you are looking for something really refined and original, then you should go to Villa Gardena located near the Planetarium and the Department of Radio and Television University of Silesia. The restaurant has won recognition and accolades year after year in the review of the best chefs in Poland.</li><li><strong>WWW:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="http://www.en.parkslaski.pl" target="_blank">http://www.en.parkslaski.pl/</a></li></ul>



<h2>#8 Main square</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1015" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9682-1.jpg 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Main square</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, the market square of Katowice is not necessarily the most beautiful in the world, but after it was rebuilt we cannot deny its uniqueness and charm. Over 6 years’ work was intended to raise the prestige of this place and attract locals and tourists again. Currently, the market consists of four squares: Kwiatowy, Teatralny, Central and Recreational (over Sztuczna Rawa). And it is probably the last one that enjoys the greatest popularity among visitors. During warm days, you can rest there in comfortable deckchairs in the shade of plane trees and real palms, which are there for the spring and summertime. The sounds of sloshing water in Artificial Rawa will make relaxation more enjoyable. The above-mentioned Artificial Rawa is a fountain shaped like a river bed marked along the real river flow and covered under the surface in Main Square.<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Where to eat:</strong> in season, we recommend considering Central Square (Plac Centralny), because this is where usually food trucks arrive from all over Poland.</li></ul>



<h2>#9 Mariacka Street (Ulica Mariacka)</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_7354-1-e1553687150684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_7354-1-e1553687150684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-911"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As there was already something for the spirit, we should conclude the article with something for the body. Mariacka is a short, only 378 meters long street in the center of Katowice, which itself is a promenade along its entire length. This is where the party-life and culinary centre of the city are focused. If you fancy cool drinks in a friendly atmosphere and a chat with your friends after a long day full of tourist attractions, you should direct your steps there. Mariacka cannot be missed!<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Sightseeing time: </strong>book an evening off;)</li><li><strong>Where to eat:</strong> In this topic, the choice is yours. Your evening will certainly not end in one restaurant or pub.</li></ul>
