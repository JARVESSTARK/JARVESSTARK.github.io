<p><strong>Giving your apartment a spring look is very pleasant: it requires no special skills or a big budget. All you need is a few accessories, spring flowers, herbs in the kitchen. The rest will be done with color and light!</strong><br><strong>See how we’ve made our apartments “spring ready”.</strong></p>



<p>The home has probably never enjoyed so much attention as now. After weeks spent inside our four walls, we know every detail of the interior and we need changes. As spring is perfect for that, it’s worth breathing some fresh air into the good old arrangement.<br>Here are some ideas directly from our interiors:</p>



<h2><strong>Let the Light In!</strong></h2>



<p>After months of darkness, enjoy opening the windows for spring. Open the dark drapes and get rid of heavy sheers. Let the light flow into the interior from dawn to dusk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="3894" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3894" class="wp-image-3894" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/światło-we-wnętrzu-1.jpg 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>If your apartment isn’t very sunny, bet on mirrors. Hang them opposite a window to catch every little sunray. Another advantage of a mirror is that it multiplies whatever you put in front of it. Even the smallest plant will look bushy and lush.</p>

<h2><strong>Play the Green Game</strong></h2>



<p>We are crazy about them. We’ve already encouraged you to get plants<a href="https://wellcome-home.com/pl/jak-byc-ekologicznym/"> </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="in this post (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/how-to-be-eco-friendly/" target="_blank">in this post</a>, praising their air-filtering properties. Put the pots in any free place on a worktop or a windowsill.<br>Make sure you know which species are shade-loving and will thrive in a minimum of light. You can put them even in a dimly-lit bathroom.</p>

<h2><strong>Be Sweet on… Herbs</strong></h2>



<p>Another place asking for more spring color is the kitchen. A worktop or a windowsill can be garnished with a line of herbs and even potted lettuce – it’ll be a beautiful decoration before being eaten.</p>

<p>And how about growing your own? The micro-leaves seeds require neither much space nor special skills. You can plant them in a small pot or a cup. They’re easy on the eye and will make a healthy spring sandwich</p>



<h2><strong>Give Yourself Flowers</strong></h2>



<p>Flowers without an occasion? Celebrating spring is enough to spoil yourself with a gift. Our favorite varieties for this season are daffodils and tulips, which can be picked up during a quick shopping trip. Divide one bunch between a few vases (or simple glass bottles) and put them all over your place.</p>

<p>The flowers ideal for a window pot are primroses, muscari flowers, and hyacinths – these are best bought when budding. As they bloom, they’ll spread their fragrance across the apartment.</p>



<h2><strong>Additional Stimulants</strong></h2>



<p>Relax, we don’t mean any illegal substances. All we need to be stimulated into action is a proper dose of color.<br>Even a single accent of the energetic sunny yellow can diametrically change the entire interior. It’ll brighten up an otherwise dull characterless interior while the contrast with a dark color on the wall or piece of furniture makes it so much more intense.<br>Our biggest allies for a quick change of arrangement are blankets, throws, and cushions of course.</p>

<h2><strong>Nature On The Wall</strong></h2>



<p>What if the view from your window never changes and fails to announce spring? Find your perfect landscape and hang it on your wall.<br>A deeply green forest, turquoise ocean, sun over the horizon – you decide what your “window” presents.</p>



<p>Large-format drawings and photos can be easily found in on-line shops along with appropriate frames. Each of our apartments has an interesting poster or picture to attract the eye.</p>

<h2><strong>Lay The Table</strong></h2>



<p>It’s not only our diet that becomes lighter in spring. The metamorphosis refers to the table itself. Let it boast the above-mentioned flowers, herbs, and the first green vegetables.<br>But, don’t forget the tableware. Choose a leaf-shaped fruit bowl or ceramic pieces matching the theme of spring. A brightly colored mug or cup will enhance a common coffee table as well.</p>

<h2><strong>Celebrate The Celebrations</strong></h2>



<p>Although we like minimalism we have a soft spot for unconventional gadgets. Even the typical Easter bunny or hen figurines can look stylish. All you need is moderation.</p>

<p>If you’re just a bit handy go for DIY decorations. Find inspiration and arrange a natural wreath. Garnish Easter decorations with greenery, flowers or herbs. The most beautiful ideas come from nature</p>

<h2><strong>Paint Your World…</strong></h2>



<p>&#8230;green and blue. If you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty, change… the color on your walls! Green or sky blue will invigorate and soothe, and breathe some fresh air into a room.<br>Relax, no need to repaint the whole apartment at once. Choose a spot that won’t require much reorganizing or moving a wardrobe.</p>



<p>A small accent will be enough to change the appearance of the entire interior. Look how unconventionally we’ve approached the color on the walls of these bedrooms.</p>

<p><strong>You don’t need a private studio to work comfortably at home. No matter how much space you have, you can find a convenient niche and arrange a home office to make your work not only more effective but more pleasant as well!</strong></p>



<p>A home office is not as unique as it used to be. These days employees are frequently offered the possibility to work remotely, which they’re happy to accept. Obviously, to sit in front of a computer in your pj’s, with your favorite mug in hand, sounds very appealing. However, anyone who has worked from home knows that lying in your bed with a laptop isn’t good in the long run. If you want to be really efficient, you must abandon the bed and sit at a desk. Fortunately, a comfy home office can be organized anywhere, even in a small apartment. How? Here are some tips.</p>



<h2><strong>Carve Out a Separate Space</strong></h2>



<p>An individual, work-only desk is a must-have. You can spread out your notes and find a place for all your work tools (tablets, laptops, etc.). A dining table, even a big one, should not moonlight as your office. You know all too well that a meal will end in you staring at the monitor and getting crumbs all over the keyboard. That’s no way to eat or work!</p>

<p>For mental balance it’s crucial to separate, physically and mentally, particular areas of an apartment, especially, when you often work remotely and spend most of your day in one room.<br>A small desk can be set up in a bedroom, placed between a wardrobe and a sofa, or aligned next to other furniture. There’re many arrangement options.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu.jpg" alt="" data-id="3590" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3590" class="wp-image-3590" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1.-biurko-w-małym-mieszkaniu-623x416.jpg 623w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h2><strong>Enjoy the View</strong></h2>



<p>Do you like the look of your traditional wall calendar? Do you hang check-lists, motivational post-its, or inspiring mood boards over your desk? Then set your desk against the wall and hang a convenient pinboard. Or, paint the wall with chalkboard paint so you can note down all the important things.</p>



<p>If you enjoy seeing daylight at work, set your desk in front of the window. However, it’s not a good idea to put it too close to the windowsill – if it’s busy outside, the view might be an unnecessary distraction.<br></p>

<h2><strong>Consider Ergonomics</strong></h2>



<p>The first question you must answer before you choose a desk is how much room you need for all your work-related items. Is a compact laptop and a mobile phone all you need? Or do you need a large workspace to put your notebooks, magazines, and piles of paper?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="3594" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3594" class="wp-image-3594" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.-fotel-biurkowy.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Additionally, if your desk is sometimes used by someone else, consider a desk with an adjustable height.<br>What you sit on is equally important. Long hours spent in an uncomfortable chair will begin to hit you. Consider a chair with an adjustable height, profiled backrest, and best of all, one with armrests. You back will appreciate it!</p>



<h2><strong>Make Room for Storage</strong></h2>



<p>If you have a soft spot for stationery, then choose a desk with drawers. They’ll help keep you organized with your pens, post-its, and other small items at hand.<br>If you often reach for books, magazines, or other printed materials, then choose a desk with an integrated bookcase or hang bookshelves directly over your desk.</p>

<p>When large enough, a worktop can provide much-needed storage space underneath. Put things in boxes, baskets, or convenient mobile shelves on wheels.</p>



<h2><strong>Bet on Modern Solutions</strong></h2>



<p>And it’s not about surrounding yourself with a great deal of unnecessary equipment. Far from it – go for minimalism. Modern technological solutions will help you keep things organized and facilitate your work.<br>It’s more convenient to have wireless devices which you can keep away from the computer without the hassle of cables.</p>

<p>Bluetooth speaker, a Wi-Fi enabled printer, an induction phone charger – especially when you’re on the phone a lot, simplify life.<br>Have your neighbors hit the renovation note, go for noise-canceling headphones which can well be used in a bustling office too.</p>



<h2><strong>Turn On the Light</strong></h2>



<p>It got dark hours ago and you haven’t even noticed? Staring at the monitor, it’s easy to forget about an additional light source. Inadequate workplace lighting causes tiredness and vision problems. A desk lamp with an adjustable height and angle of light can be the best option.</p>



<p>Besides its health and functional aspect, dedicated lighting will also provide a sense of separation between the workspace and home area. It’s especially important in small apartments where one room serves as several zones and has many functions. </p>

<h2><strong>Personalize Your Surroundings</strong></h2>



<p>Working remotely, you’ll spend most of your day in this workspace. Make the space around you as pleasant to the eye as the rest of your place. Add your favorite color to the wall (or board), place holiday photos insight and include some potted plants or a bookcase. Whatever makes you happy and motivated, but not distracted.<br>If music helps you focus, listen to your favorite playlist. Add a subtle fragrance. Your good mood depends on many factors.</p>

<h2><strong>Tidy up!</strong></h2>



<p>Tidy up, a simple rule we all seem to know, but tend to ignore more often than not, especially if you work in a home office.<br>You work late, your desk collects coffee mugs, outdated notes, piles of books. Your feet get stuck in tangles of cables below. Stop! In the mess, your thoughts are a mess too.</p>



<p>Make it a habit to straighten up after you finish working. If you can see the rest of your apartment, and if it needs it, sweep, do the dishes, or make your bed. Sweat pants or no sweat pants – your workspace deserves respect.</p>

<p><strong>The new year is a perfect opportunity for lifestyle changes and let’s include interior design with that. Do you need inspiration to plan a small redecoration or do you simply like to keep current? Here is a short guide to the most interesting trends of 2020.</strong></p>



<p>We like to closely follow changes in fashion. After all, the final look of the space we design is equally important as its comfort and functionality. Nonetheless, in the avalanche of trends and influx of novelties, we try to find those that match our apartments and our lifestyle. We’ve reviewed this year’s trends for you and ranked our TOP 10.</p>



<h2>1. <strong>Sustainability</strong></h2>



<p><em>Sustainability</em> has recently been named the most popular global trend. It’d be hard to call it a passing fashion – interest in environmental issues is no longer a whim and has become well-rooted in our lives. Little wonder that it’s also reached the realm of interiors. Using natural materials, buying furniture and accessories from local suppliers and from reputable sources, refinishing, repurposing, and buying second hand, are the keys to successful <em>sustainability</em> in interior design. </p>



<p>The main goal of <em>sustainability</em> is to protect the environment, and it resonates louder and stronger than ever. Whoever used to avoid this topic and convince themself that it was other people’s problem, simply must face it now. And this is great, because <em>sustainability</em> brings endless opportunities to show off your interior design talent and equally great satisfaction!</p>

<h2>2. Biophilia</h2>



<p>Another trendy word which might sound mysterious, but it’s very intuitive. It’s (obviously) all about our becoming closer to nature. Regarding interior design, biophilia means being surrounded by plants and the more the better.</p>



<p>The beneficial effects plants have on our health and wellbeing have been proven by scientists, so it’s not worth disputing facts. Instead, let’s head to the garden, forest or florist’s, so we can add some green. Whether it’s popular succulents or terrariums – the choice is so vast that everyone can find something for sure. Lacking a green thumb is no longer an excuse either. There are a lot of plants resistant to our forgetfulness and general plant clumsiness (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/how-to-be-eco-friendly/" target="_blank">here</a> you can find some of our green recommendations).</p>

<h2>3. A Second Chance</h2>



<p>The next eco-trend which perfectly matches the idea of sustainability as well as the popular “DIY” trend is giving furniture a second chance. Refinishing an old piece of furniture, finding things at flea markets or buying at auctions – it’s not only saving money and being eco, but also a very fashionable approach!</p>



<p>Second-hand furniture often have timeless designs and their own unique history. Many times, they had been produced with care from good quality materials. We like them, we hunt for them, and we’re happy to place such pieces in our interiors.</p>

<h2>4. Colors of Nature</h2>



<p>Basic white and Scandinavian grays are timeless and will always have their admirers. However, this season takes a step towards nature and introduces earth tones to our interiors. It can be shades of beige on the walls and warm browns rule the wooden floors and countertops.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1.jpeg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-1024x551.jpeg" alt="" data-id="3433" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1.jpeg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3433" class="wp-image-3433" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-1024x551.jpeg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-300x161.jpeg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-768x413.jpeg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-1536x826.jpeg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-340x183.jpeg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-74x40.jpeg 74w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1-774x416.jpeg 774w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KOLORY-ZIEMI-W-SALONIE-1.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">Natural shades of wooden floor make for a cozy feeling.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dark walls are still in fashion – instead of black, they should be painted a deep bottle green, which is peaceful and calming. Having tried it in our interiors, we can confirm: it makes our minds wander among the forest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="3434" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3434" class="wp-image-3434" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butelkowa-zieleń-w-sypialni-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">Bottle green bedroom &#8211; ideal to have a rest.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>5. (Almost Like) Marble</h2>



<p>Natural materials – just like bright colors – enjoy everlasting popularity. The textures and colors of marble, quartz, and granite have many devotees. Yet, the price of natural stone frequently dampens the spirit of potential buyers.</p>



<p>Do you know this dilemma all too well? Then bet on composites! They’re produced from natural chippings and make for a cheaper (and more durable) alternative to the real thing. Moreover, scraps from production are recycled and put to good use. And so we become more eco-friendly once again!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="3435" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3435" class="wp-image-3435" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parapet-konglomerat-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">A composite on window sill looks like a natural stone. </figcaption></figure>



<h2>6. Maxi Option</h2>



<p>Are you for a big break from the Scandinavian simplicity? Then this year you can go wild as maximalism enters the living room. Richly ornamented ceilings, molding on the walls, rich paintings, and gold accents – it is all hot now.</p>



<p>If you’re not convinced by the Baroque splendor, start with a few small features. A decorative mirror frame, a colorful carpet, a large lamp are all changeable elements and easy to configure. Additionally, a small space needs only one element and the entire effect will be achieved. Be brave!</p>

<h2>7. Fabrics and Patterns</h2>



<p>Linen, wool, cotton &#8211; natural materials are always a big yes, but this season they come in strong colors and a variety of patterns. Embossed cushions, velvet sofa covers, a decorative bed throw in your favorite shade, all will bring an instant change at almost no cost.<br>To the brave, we recommend richly decorated wallpaper with a floral or animal motifs. They’re the absolute hit of the season.</p>

<h2>8. Bicolored</h2>



<p>We must admit, plain white kitchen cabinets are the simplest, almost the safest solution. And things can happen in the kitchen as well!<br>This season open shelves give way to fully fronted cabinets, bravely divided between two colors. Black bottoms and white tops are classic of course. Go wild with the color of the bottom cabinets. Green, turquoise, blue? The choice is yours.</p>

<h2>9. Lighting</h2>



<p>Lamps have long been the underappreciated element of interiors, humbly devoted to functionality. With the popularity of the industrial style, they shyly left their hiding places, assuming visible, simple metal forms.<br>Here (finally) comes the time of the lamp! More and more boldly, we reach for fancy, richly decorated lighting and also play with light itself. In colors of gold, copper or brass, plus the bulbs in stylish sockets – this is what should be hanging over our heads these days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="3441" data-full-url="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1.jpg" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=3441" class="wp-image-3441" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SZ7_150_01-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">A lamp became the main decoration of this space.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>10. Multi-functional Space</h2>



<p>Finally, something we like a lot – multi-functionality.<br>Modern spaces should be multi-use. We’ve given up on the lifeless rooms used “on special occasions” and focus on what’s really needed.</p>



<p>The trend of opening the living room and combining it with the kitchen has been around for a good several years. Now, however, we combine the bedroom with the home office as well. Thanks to smart organization, a modern open space is no longer chaos. The maximum use of your space which – even when it’s small – can be very cozy and equally functional<br>(we can confirm this).</p>

<p><strong>Naturalness is back in fashion, and in our homes. For a while now we’ve been reaching for natural materials to decorate our apartments. What makes them so universal and how can we use their potential in our interiors?</strong></p>



<p>Natural materials are always a good choice. They’re durable, environmentally-friendly, improve the microclimate of indoor spaces, and look stylish regardless of interior design and changing styles. We’re presenting our favorite materials, their main advantages and innumerable ways of ingenious arrangements.</p>



<h2>Wood</h2>



<p>Without a doubt, it’s the most appreciated natural material used in interior design. It’s enjoyed enduring popularity for years and it seems to still be on the rise. This surely results from the trend for all kinds of crafts as well as increasing ecological awareness. We all know about the highly popular tables and bookcases made of pallets.<br>Wood is universal, cozy, and easy to work with. With all its advantages, it’s little wonder that wood has so many fans.</p>



<p><strong>What are the main advantages of wood?</strong></p>



<p>Properly seasoned and dried, this material is virtually timeless and everlasting. It can be renewed and restored. Depending on the type, wood can take on various colors and textures – from good old light pine, through darker oak, all the way to the increasingly popular exotic types like Merbau and wenge. <br>Wood’s texture is varied, which makes this material unique. It’s a good thermal and electrical insulator and can support considerable weight. Wood ages beautifully and matches every style, providing interiors with a sense of warmth and coziness.</p>



<p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Wood works well as a finishing material for floors. Properly prepared boards can be installed directly on floor heating systems commonly used in houses. Traditional sanded parquet, in turn, will be a beautiful addition to an old elegant apartment.</li><li>Wood can be used for furniture, kitchen or bathroom cabinets, and spacious wardrobes.</li><li>Wooden doors and window frames have undeniable charm as well.</li><li>Recycled wood has been very popular of late – boards from an old shed will be ideal for a rustic tabletop, cabinet fronts or decorative wall paneling.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Natural brick wall goes well with metal and concrete and has a unique texture.</em></p>



<h2>Stone</h2>



<p>The oldest construction material still remains popular today. Often associated with austerity, well-selected stone has unlimited use in interior design. There are many interesting types of natural stone available on the market and everyone can find something to meet one&#8217;s needs and preferences. Fans of timelessness will surely be fascinated by marble. The enthusiasts of warm classic colors will choose travertine or sandstone, while more grand interior designs will benefit from the use of granite or basalt. </p>



<p><strong>What are the main advantages of stone?</strong></p>



<p>Stone finishes are characterized by high durability as well as water, heat, and damage resistance.<br>Another important aspect is their visual effect. Various types of stone differ in color, texture, and finishes. This diversity is appreciated by the fans of natural solutions. When polished, stone will reflect light, while a natural finish will surprise you with its unique texture.<br>Choosing the type of stone for a particular solution, one should also pay attention to its characteristics. For places exposed to the elements, the best quality is recommended.</p>



<p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Stone surfaces are ideal for minimalist interiors where they can easily replace traditional floor tiles.</li><li>Also, an interesting and sophisticated solution will be using stone to finish a fireplace surround or accent one decorative wall in the living room.</li><li>A properly selected stone countertop for the kitchen will be more durable than a wooden one and add elegance. In a rustic interior, a popular solution is to install a stone farmer sink.</li><li>If you like stone, but can’t really find a place to apply it in your apartment, think about using it as the windowsill. Classic light marble or quartz will beautifully emphasize white window frames.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Stone surfaces are perfect for the windowsill or kitchen backsplash.</em></p>



<h2>Metal</h2>



<p>The first thing that comes to our mind thinking about metal is its rawness and coldness, along with elegance. It’s mandatory and most popular for industrial style. Skilfully combined with other materials, metal will work well in every interior – even the more traditional or modern ones. Additionally, it has a number of advantages, which make it a desirable finishing material.</p>



<p><strong>What are the main advantages of metal?</strong></p>



<p>It’s a particularly durable material and can be used both indoors and outdoors (for stairs, railings, etc.). Metal can carry large loads well, while looking very light. They are therefore used for openwork bookcases, tables, and chairs. Metal is also resistant to physical damage as well as chemical and atmospheric factors. </p>



<p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Metal is most commonly used in the previously mentioned industrial style interiors, in which metal accents the large storage spaces, and the bare pipes multiply the effect.</li><li>This material is also great side by side with natural wood, which is why heavy wooden tabletops are often rested on metal legs.</li><li>The brave of heart can venture to have a metal floor or a metal kitchen countertop, while more modern designs can smuggle metal in accessories: lamps, cabinet handles, and curtain rods.</li><li>The enthusiasts of warm colors don’t have to be limited to aluminium, nickel or steel. Accessories made from copper and brass can be equally elegant and much cozier at the same time.</li></ul>

<p><strong>When decorating a small apartment we face many dilemmas: practicality or looks? Minimalism or coziness? If you are not sure how to arrange your four walls to make them functional, comfortable, and first and foremost “yours”, keep on reading our smart handbook.</strong></p>



<p>A small apartment doubtlessly has its advantages – less space means lower expenses, less space to furnish, arrange, and clean. Easier access to attractions and facilities offered by the city also works in favor of a better location at the cost of (often) a smaller space. Regardless of the space, your apartment needs to be functional and multi-purposed: it is where you will relax, prepare food, work, study, and host guests. Pay attention to all aspects – from practicality, through comfort, all the way to attractive looks. With a little help from our handbook, you’ll tackle this challenge like an experienced interior designer. </p>



<h2>1. <strong>Arrange Independent Zones</strong></h2>



<p>Even if your apartment is limited to one small room, remember to divide it into various zones. Don’t give up on a sofa which makes up a living room and allows you to conveniently seat your guests. Separate the kitchenette with a table and a few chairs. This will provide for a small dining area as well as the sense of fluid transition between “rooms”. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-1024x643.jpeg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-1024x643.jpeg" alt="" data-id="2813" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=2813" class="wp-image-2813" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-1024x643.jpeg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-768x482.jpeg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-340x214.jpeg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-64x40.jpeg 64w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1-662x416.jpeg 662w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dining-table-ideas-1.jpeg 1966w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>Even a small table and two chairs will provide for a small dining area.</em></p>



<p>Do you happen to work at home sometimes? Be sure to have a free-standing desk and a comfortable chair! Even a small desktop, when dedicated solely to work, will give you the possibility to mentally separate duties from leisure. We’re fully aware that a bedroom is often an unattainable luxury in a small flat, but maybe it has enough room for a wooden mezzanine? All it needs is a comfy mattress and the space below can be assigned to be a small home office or a cozy corner. Make sure to accent the entrance – separate it with a bookcase or a coat closet to give a sense of a separate hall.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>A mezzanine is a clever idea for the independent sleeping area.</em> <em>Below you can arrange a small desk</em>.</p>



<h2>2. <strong>Use Special Purpose Furniture</strong></h2>



<p>Arranging a small space, your ally will be multipurpose furniture. Besides comfort, the sofa must be easily convertible – it turns into a bed every night after all. It should have bedding storage. The comforter and pillows take up a lot of room and they must be quickly out of sight in the morning.<br>An express arrangement change can be obtained by means of wheeled tables (you can move them fast) or nesting tables – they do not take up too much space.<br>Rather than armchairs, invest in ottoman, best on wheels as well and with extra storage (never too much). In a small bathroom, use the space above the toilet – the color of the medicine cabinet should match the fittings, and it will be inconspicuous.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>To rearrange your space easily, wheeled or nesting tables will be the best.</em></p>



<h2>3. <strong>Personalize and Change</strong></h2>



<p>In a small apartment, every centimeter is precious. When setting out to decorate, consider a wardrobe according to your needs. Remember it has to store not only your clothes and shoes, but also a vacuum cleaner, an ironing board, suitcases, etc. You don’t need to have it custom-made. More and more furniture stores are offering customizable solutions and you adjust them to your needs. It’s a much more economical, quicker, and still highly functional approach.<br>Careful planning refers also to the kitchenette where every centimeter is important. Dedicate available space to have more worktop surface with a small fridge integrated under it. How about a two-burner stove? It will suffice to cook dinner and you will gain an additional 30 cm of counter space. Consider a small integrated dishwasher – it is not only convenient, but also a clever way of keeping all the dirty dishes out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>In this tiny kitchen, there is enough space for a two-burner stove and an integrated fridge.</em></p>



<h2>4. <strong>Let in Some Light…</strong></h2>



<p>Bright interiors seem optically larger, so expose the light to the maximum. Start with the windows – don’t cover them with dark curtains. Paint the window recesses white so that they reflect the sunlight. Choose light colors for the walls – classic white or your favorite pale shades. If your tiny windowless bathroom is covered with dark tiles – repaint them! You can find many good quality paints for this purpose these days.<br>Make friends with mirrors. Nicely framed, they will decorate the space like stylish paintings and their role in optical enlargement of the room is invaluable. Not only do they reflect light, but they also create an illusion of multiplying the space.&nbsp;For cabinet fronts – especially the large ones – choose bright and glossy colors which will additionally reflect the light.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Mirrors reflect light and enlarge a small room. </em></p>



<h2>5. <strong>…and Use it to Build Atmosphere</strong></h2>



<p>Light has power! Used skilfully it will not only optically enlarge the apartment but also “close-in” any intricately arranged space and build its unique atmosphere. This function is especially important when you share your space with another person.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="2786" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=2786" class="wp-image-2786" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/living-room-lighting.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>Lighting can build a unique atmosphere.</em></p>



<p>Task lighting over the kitchen countertop will illuminate the workspace and allow you to prepare a snack without turning on the main lights. A strong spotlight at your desk will enable you to work even when the other person would like to go to sleep. A warm floor lamp will be good for relaxing on the sofa, and the dining space will be well accented by a light hanging directly over the table. A fast arrangement change can be achieved with mobile floor lamps, and for reading you can use small clip-on lights which you can attach to the shelf over your sofa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Task lighting is essential to accent the working or resting area.</em></p>



<h2>6. Be Creative</h2>



<p>Although furniture manufacturers are more and more inventive, you don’t have to restrict yourself only to the solutions they offer. Put your thinking cap on and try to use what you already have. The window sill can be arranged as a bookshelf or (if wide enough) covered with cushions and turned into a small “settee”, when unexpected visitors arrive.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="2789" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=2789" class="wp-image-2789" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/window-sill-bookshelf.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li></ul>



<p>A bookcase can be used as a partition “wall”. Instead of a classic coffee table, put a comfy ottoman near the sofa and when coffee is served, cover it with a butler’s tray.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Smart partition &#8220;wall&#8221; can have multiple uses.</em></p>



<h2>7. <strong>Play with Illusions</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve already learned that light, mirrors, and bright colors can work miracles. There are more tricks at your disposal though. High ceilings give a sense of space. If you don’t live in an old apartment house, you can optically “lift” the ceiling. Hang a curtain rod as high as possible and hang long curtains all the way to the floor. Use vertical forms such as pictures in lengthwise frames and vertically oriented mirrors.<br>Baseboards should match the color of the walls which lets you add a few centimeters to the room. Choose openwork furniture that seems lighter and doesn’t block the light. Make sure that sofas, wardrobes, and bookcases have small legs. The thinner they are, the lighter the final effect.</p>

<h2>8. <strong>Pay Attention to Details</strong></h2>



<p>Has your apartment been renovated, decorated, and furnished? Still, you can change it with a few simple procedures and relatively cheaply. When selecting decorative accessories, focus on large forms rather than knick-knacks for shelves to avoid unnecessary clutter.<br>Cover your dark sofa with a bright throw, change heavy curtains into light, see-through ones. Decorate empty walls with your favorite posters – interesting details will not only create atmosphere, but also drive attention away from the small space. Add some potted plants. Green and lush accents are a breath of fresh air anytime.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>A unique character of your flat can be achieved by details &#8211; pillows, blankets, posters.</em></p>



<h2>9. <strong>Tidy Up</strong></h2>



<p>It may be a cliché, but a clean orderly space makes it easier to breathe and think. In a small studio apartment, you can’t close the bedroom door or toss a pile of unnecessary things into the other room. Done regularly, cleaning should not take much time. <br>Have seasonal reviews – get rid of unnecessary things, go through your clothes, and put away what is out of season. Your unrivaled allies will be storage vacuum bags.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Custom-made wardrobe will help you to keep everything in the order. </em></p>



<h2>10. <strong>Make Yourself at Home</strong></h2>



<p>Don’t give up on the final appearance of your apartment and don’t look for functional solutions at any cost. After all, your place should respond to your needs. Think what makes you happy – do you prefer to cook and have a larger fridge or is an additional shoe rack of more use to you?<br>Introduce your favorite color in the form of easily-changeable accessories – pillows, bedding, a tablecloth or a blanket. Expose what is important to you – may be books or your favorite travel photos? Remember moderation and follow your own style.</p>

<p><strong>We can talk for hours about interior design styles. Hence, another article in which we look at the most exciting directions and follow the trail of inspiring places. This time we focus on the connections: not blatant, <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">colourful</g> and sometimes very bold. Check out three interior styles that will awaken your passion for combining interesting elements: eclectic style, boho, <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">and</g> glamour. Long live bright connections!</strong></p>



<p>Today, broadly understood applied art is often called a hybrid, a mix, or a remix. It sounds like a mantra: everything was here before, and we can&#8217;t reinvent the wheel. It turns out that the cure for boredom and an effective way to create something fresh are combinations of styles, colors, structures, and materials. We observe the phenomenon in various areas of art: in fashion, design, as well as in interior architecture. Combining even seemingly mismatched elements is a great way to emphasize the uniqueness of a place that the owner is not afraid to express. The three interior styles we are going to write about today are high in the era of the remix. And although each of them has different roots, they all enjoy unflagging interest.</p>



<h2>Eclectic style</h2>



<p>Anyone who has ever arranged a flat from scratch knows that the final vision rarely reflects only one style. When planning a space arrangement, we are looking for inspiration. We watch hundreds of catalogs and implementations. We check the store offers and comb the best examples in search of the dream climate. Effect? Our interior is often a selection of favorite elements, furniture, objects and colors with which we feel good. And nothing terrible about it, because eclecticism is just about skillfully combining styles.</p>



<p>Eclecticism is a fairly broad concept that comes from art and architecture, and its guiding principle is to combine various elements, styles, eras and artistic directions. The eclectic style places almost no formal restrictions on the creators. However, attention, following this lead, quickly falls into the trap of mismatches. Eclecticism, due to the great freedom in the selection of elements, also requires an extremely aesthetic sense. If anyone thinks of it as interior anarchy, they are wrong. The mismatch in eclectic interiors is always only apparent. From the furniture, colors, structures or materials accidentally combined, a completely original, but well-thought-out arrangement should emerge.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>The eclectic style is about combining styles, colors, and textures.</em></p>



<p><strong>Who should choose this style?</strong></p>



<p>First of all, for exceptionally creative people who have a sense of combining seemingly mismatched elements. They can combine a stylish and elegant sideboard with an almost futuristic mirror, and use intense colors in the background. Eclecticism is for those who are close to artistic disorder, like to combine distant textures, patterns, <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">and</g> colors. If you are masters of ordering chaos – eclecticism can become your weapon in the fight for the dream interior. It is an original style for those looking for equally innovative solutions.</p>



<p><strong>How can it be achieved?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to mix and match. If you see sense in the combination of items from entirely different worlds, and also, you can easily find a place for them in your new salon – go with the flow.</li><li>Choose items that are important to you (e.g. souvenirs, antique furniture, critical artistic works). They will be the heart of your arrangement.</li><li>Check which colors dominate the necessary elements of the interior and choose accessories and additions in matching colors to them. Colour dialogue can work wonders even when combining very distant styles or textures.</li><li>Dare to contrast. Tradition and modernity. Pastel and intense colors. Mat and flash. Let your imagination go. </li></ul>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>The eclectic interior creates a coherent space.</em></p>



<p><strong>Where can you find inspiration?</strong></p>



<p>If we write that eclectic style is everywhere, we will not overdo it. You will find eclectic inspiration in many places, even if you haven&#8217;t noticed it before. In Silesia, there are plenty of arrangements that are a great showcase of the eclectic style and delight with original solutions. In Katowice, check a few pubs, and visit places such as Upojeni or Mały Kredens.</p>



<h2>Boho</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a style that dates back to the 1960s. And we are talking about the time of the hippie flower power movement, which used the full palette of colors and patchwork, but above all gave unprecedented creative freedom. Today&#8217;s shape of the boho style is mostly a tribute to the colorful era of flower kids and a way to break the routine. Its hallmarks are furniture and accessories in the form of the 60s, and interiors filled with colorful mosaics, ethnic patterns, and sometimes even folk motifs. Everything under the mantle of artistic nonchalance. After all, the name boho comes from the artistic bohemia.</p>



<p>In the boho style, colorful flowers effortlessly combine with geometric forms, and folk patterns sometimes create a slightly psychedelic dream. These seemingly incompatible styles can be arranged in a remarkably coherent –and thus –also extremely eye-friendly arrangement. A flat or a modern boho style office is a flick of a nose, as well as a cozy and eye-catching place.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Boho style allows you to create unique arrangements freely.</em></p>



<p><strong>Who should choose this style?</strong></p>



<p>Boho is an excellent proposition for brave people looking for original solutions in their interiors. If you want to create a comfortable corner for yourself with a unique atmosphere, and you have had enough routine, subdued colors or perfectly matching items – go for boho. It is an excellent patent to emphasize the individual character of the creator. Someone who loves boho has an artistic soul and is not afraid of original connections. That&#8217;s for sure.</p>



<p><strong>How can it be achieved?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Choose an intense color. Let your interiors have strong accents: a fuchsia sofa, yellow armchair or turquoise curtains perfectly fit into the colorful boho style.</li><li>Bet on patchwork in any form: image, artistic wallpaper or pillowcases created from scraps of various materials.</li><li>Don&#8217;t be afraid of original connections if you are wondering if the geometric 60s-style sideboard will match the kilim with ethnic patterns – break it down. It makes sense.</li><li>Find the right place for travel photos, unusual items, and souvenirs. In the boho style, even the most surprising thing can gain a significant role in the interior.</li><li>Give the interior a cozy atmosphere. Think of scented candles or small lamps that decorate a window, wall or pieces of furniture.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Where can you find inspiration?</strong></p>



<p>The boho style has been enjoying a great interest in interior and design lovers for several years. In Silesia, you can find many places that derive full boho style. To a large extent, these are pubs that create an atmosphere of artistic nonchalance, surprising with colors and unusual combinations. One example of the boho style inspiration is the bold interiors of Złoty Osioł. Lunch tastes excellent in such a colorful atmosphere.</p>



<h2>Glamour</h2>



<p>Chic and luminous interiors – that&#8217;s how you can define glamour style. It is worth knowing because even if it does not fully meet your tastes, it is currently one of the hottest interior design trends. Arrangements in glamour style tempt with extraordinary elegance, but also with an almost magical glow. The glamour style draws inspiration from the Baroque era, but it is also firmly rooted in modernity. Glamour hallmarks are appeal, decoration and extraordinary arrangement courage.</p>



<p>Glamour style loves gold, silver, elegant black, as well as a rich palette of pink and purple. Remember that the excess of intense colors can be overwhelming. Break the fierce black, silver or fuchsia with muted tones of blue, green or delicate beige. Glamour is also a high gloss. Large, shiny tables, glass surfaces, and accessories flashing in the light give the interior tinsel. Even crystal chandeliers, gilded dishes or richly decorated door handles, if used in moderation, can beautifully decorate space. It is worth remembering that if there are too many strong accents in the room, the effect can be associated with kitsch, not a luxury. Therefore, prudence is advisable.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Glamour interiors captivate with beautiful details.</em></p>



<p><strong>Who should choose this style?</strong></p>



<p>Glamour is a perfect choice for people who want to feel a breath of luxury and refinement in their interiors. This particular style is an excellent option for those who can sensitively combine the style of past years with modernity. Combine beautiful, decorated furniture with simple forms of electronic equipment. Stylized accessories (such as chandeliers) often have a modern twist (they are, for example, black). Whoever catches these subtle elements and has a sense of combining distant objects will be celebrated in glamour style.</p>



<p><strong>How can it be achieved?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Dare to make powerful color combinations. Glamour loves the most elegant shades of pink, purple and black, which breaks the glow of gold or silver.</li><li>Look for furniture and accessories styled for past ages. Baroque with its elegance, decorations and splendor is the key here.

Glamour loves to shine, so choose shiny vases, decorated furniture handles or gently shimmering fabrics.</li></ul>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Glamour style is above all shine and bold color accents.</em></p>



<p><strong>Where can you find inspiration?</strong></p>



<p>Glamour style is not only beautiful interiors of spacious houses. The arrangement made with taste works well also in apartments (especially those located in historic tenements with high ceilings look gorgeous), but also in office spaces or luxury service salons. It is hardly surprising. The beautifully decorated interior glamour brings associations with luxury.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>There are interiors in which we feel more like ourselves. They are cozy, tailored to our personalities, expectations, and interests, where everything is well coordinated and forms one coherent concept. Some of us need space, modern forms, and bold means of expression; others seek a warm, idyllic atmosphere, and coziness. Just like in music or fashion, an apartment can have its own individual style defining its character and inhabitants. You don’t know which style will be perfect for you? Welcome to a guide on this topic! Let&#8217;s start with options perfect for the enthusiasts of simplicity and harmony.</strong><br></p>



<p>Nowadays we are flooded with interior design inspirations daily. We collect them while travelling, copy from our friends, see them in interesting brasseries or our favorite TV series, often being unaware that we can be advocates of a particular style. If we want to create an interior maintained in a similar atmosphere, we must ensure cohesion and creativity, and remain patient whilst looking for furniture or accessories corresponding to a particular style. Nonetheless, as early as during the planning stage, it is good to think through the whole concept and stick to the general principles defining the chosen trend. Of course, this is not about 1 to 1 copying, but about a creative variation on a given topic. After all, the apartment is supposed to reflect our own inner self and have a unique character.</p>



<p><strong>Today, we present three styles that will be particularly appreciated by fans of simplicity, functional design, and soft colors.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Minimalism</strong></h2>



<p>Less is more. This one sentence will suffice to describe this interior design style. Minimalism is not about creating empty, soulless spaces, but about achieving harmony and perfection. There is no room for coincidence and gaudy accessories. Here everything is well thought out and designed for silence and simplicity. This style is defined by a palette of subdued colors (usually whites, beiges, browns, grays, and blacks &#8211; although in some designs they are contrasted with something more expressive e.g. red or orange).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="1897" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/minimalizm/" class="wp-image-1897" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimalizm.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Bright colors, furniture with flat surfaces, and minimum accessories.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Furniture, which is reduced to a minimum, has simple geometric shapes, large flat surfaces, and hidden handles. The prevailing materials used for finishing are: concrete, glass, metal, and sometimes wood. As for the accessories and decorations, they are significantly limited and always well thought out so they will harmonize with the remaining elements. The functionality of objects, their elegant style, and high quality are important. In a minimalist design, everything that is not used at a given moment is invisible. There is no chance for cosmetics being placed around the bathtub or coffee cups put on the kitchen counter.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-1024x683.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="1905" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/?attachment_id=1905" class="wp-image-1905" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/minimal-kuchnia-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>A minimalist kitchen composed in a small space.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<h3>Who should choose this style? </h3>



<p>Despite being simple this style is not the easiest one. It will suit organized and disciplined people who always put things back in the right place and strive for perfection,&nbsp; The ‘ideological’ basis of this style is also crucial. It is not only about a nice design, but also about getting rid of unnecessary items from your life. Certainly, it is not a style for people who expect a cozy, idyllic character, and enjoy surrounding themselves with a myriad of knickknacks.</p>



<h3>How can it be achieved?</h3>



<ul><li>Opt for modern design with subdued colors.</li><li>Keep furniture to a minimum &#8211; preferably with a ‘push-to-open’&nbsp; system without handles.</li><li>Install good lighting and create a feeling of spaciousness.</li><li>Think in a way that will allow you to hide things that you are not using at a given moment.</li><li>Add some rhythm and harmony to your interior.</li></ul>



<h3>Where can you find inspiration?</h3>



<p>The minimalist style is in the spotlight these days. In the Silesia region many structures are now being built, referring to this trend both with their architectural and interior design. In Katowice, minimalistic inspiration can be found in some rooms of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Silesian Museum (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/9-must-see-places-in-katowice/" target="_blank">Silesian Museum</a> and in the spaces of the International Congress Center. We also recommend popping in for breakfast to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Local Bakery (otwiera się na nowej zakładce)" href="https://wellcome-home.com/blog/best-breakfast-in-katowice/" target="_blank">Local Bakery</a> &#8211; to search for minimalist inspiration in its dining area.</p>



<h2><strong>Scandinavian Style</strong></h2>



<p>Since minimalism was derived from the philosophy of Zen, there’s no place for cozy blankets, pillows, and fabrics. However, in the Scandinavian style that combines functionality with coziness, such additions are a must. Inspired by the Danish <em>hygge</em> philosophy (comfort, convenience, internal security, and balance) and Swedish <em>lagom</em> (simply translated as: ‘just right’) the Scandinavian school combines minimalism with a home-made style and natural fabrics. There is also plenty of room for wood, leather, cotton, linen, and wool. The prevailing colors are whites, grays, and beiges, sometimes contrasted with e.g. blue. Gold is becoming more and more popular, adding a touch of elegance and originality.</p>

<p>Designer furniture (of which Scandinavians are famous for) is made of wood and natural elements, giving it an elegant, but cozy character. It must be comfortable and designed for relaxing. Significant elements here are various accessories that break the white and complement the whole &#8211; wicker baskets, vases, lamps, armchairs, poufs, scented candles, and flowers. It&#8217;s about aesthetics and functionality, but in its family and more friendly version.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="1848" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/skandynawski-2/" class="wp-image-1848" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skandynawski-2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><br>Clean, clear, cozy &#8211; typical distinguishing features of the Scandinavian style.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<h3>Who should choose this style? </h3>



<p>If you like bright, spatial interiors with modern design, geared to be functional and at the same time avoid the harsh character and appreciate the homey, cozy atmosphere, you will definitely like the Scandinavian style. Such interiors combine the best in minimalism and nature with a truly homey atmosphere.</p>



<h3>How can it be achieved?</h3>



<ul><li>Choose white as the base color.</li><li>Remember about the functional aspect of the interior &#8211; everything must serve a specific purpose.</li><li>Use natural materials and do not forget about wood.</li><li>Break the monotony with eclectic accessories and designer furniture with a Scandinavian ‘pedigree’.</li></ul>



<h3>Where can you find inspiration?</h3>



<p>Well known Scandinavian furniture chains are a great reference point to seek inspiration in this topic. Even if we want to choose slightly higher quality furniture, the very assumptions of this style and the way the accessories and materials are combined can be found there.</p>



<h2><strong>Industrial Style</strong></h2>



<p>Factories, warehouses, and former industrial sites &#8211; as the name suggests, the industrial style is exactly what has been taken from such places and converted into residential space. This is where this style derived its main distinguishing features from. What if we are fond of lofts and post-industrial interiors, but live in an apartment house? After all, the interiors of this type are characterized by high ceilings, huge windows, and austerity, which is difficult to achieve in a small building. Are you sure? Well, not really. Elements of this style can be successfully transferred to apartments, giving them a fashionable style of lofts and creating an extraordinary space.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="1843" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/industrial-4/" class="wp-image-1843" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/industrial-4.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><br>Brick and raw accessories are some of the hallmarks of the Industrial style.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>The dominant colors are whites and all shades of gray and colors reminiscent of steel, tin, and copper. Other important elements are exposed brick walls, metal finishing, and heating pipes, as well as wires and sockets located on the surface. The basis of this type of interior is also minimalism and lack of excess. As in the two previous styles, things have their functional character. When choosing accessories, however, it is worth taking care of their industrial dimension &#8211; a small safe for documents, a chest with metal fittings for clothes or a lamp straight from a factory will add some feisty taste.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-1024x684.jpg"><img src="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-1024x684.jpg" alt="" data-id="1892" data-link="https://wellcome-home.com/damrota_4-0081-2/" class="wp-image-1892" srcset="https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-340x227.jpg 340w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-60x40.jpg 60w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081-623x416.jpg 623w, https://wellcome-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Damrota_4-0081.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><br>Black, dark accessories, and geometric lamps give the interior a slightly industrial character.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<h3>Who should choose this style? </h3>



<p>Interiors of this type are bold and raw at the same time. Brick&#8217;s character gives them warmth and makes them emanate with unusual energy. This type of design will certainly be appreciated by creative people looking for fresh arrangements and industrial materials such as steel, glass, and concrete.</p>



<h3>How can it be achieved?</h3>



<ul><li>Do you live in a building made of large concrete blocks? Think about stuff imitating this material or a good quality wallpaper to decorate one of the walls.</li><li>Instead of traditional wood flooring, install tiles imitating stone.</li><li>Use concrete and glass &#8211; including large mirrors.</li><li>Look for Steampunk-Style accessories.</li><li>Opt for furniture and lamps with metal elements and fittings or shelves entirely made of metal, which are reminiscent of a factory.</li><li>If possible, expose pipes and cables outside the plaster or choose pewter or copper covers.</li></ul>



<h3>Where can you find inspiration?</h3>



<p>Katowice, as well as the entire area of ​​Upper Silesia, is an excellent area for industrial enthusiasts. Bolko Loft in Bytom &#8211; a work of a well-known architect Przemo Łukasik, is the best-known example of this type. In Katowice, it is worth checking the inspiration for Szyb Wilson or the Porcelain Factory. In nearby Gliwice, however, similar flavors can be found in the renovated buildings of the former KWK Gliwice (the so-called Nowe Gliwice) or in the Wine Bar Lofty restaurant.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The New Year means also new interior design trends. Pastel colors, bold combinations and maximalism are the hits of the coming season. It is time for interior changes.</strong></p>
<h4>Pastel colours with some marker</h4>
<p>Priority is still given to colours which will appear in their pastel version now, being a perfect base for strong markers and dark hues. Light lilac, willow green, light yellow or dusty and whitish light blue are the most fashionable colour trends this year. The colour of 2019 is the caramel spiced honey, beige, orange with apricot, peach and brown (mostly white coffee or chocolate). And those are the colours which will be present in our flats.</p>
<h4>Large and abundant — It is time for maximalism</h4>
<p>The era of cool minimalism is followed by the time for maximalism. This year&#8217;s trends will be dominated by bold and distinct combinations of textures, colours and patterns. The flowery patterns and dark hues which started to appear here and there in the previous season will play a key role in the decorations and main motifs. The combination of dark and pastel colours will predominate over last year&#8217;s fluorescent markers.</p>
<h4>Back to the past</h4>
<p>We are going round in a circle to make the ovals our favourite yet again. This season, the angular furniture is replaced by the rounded ones, inspired by 1970s. The interiors will be filled with rounded armchairs and chairs, round tables and cylinder-shaped coffee tables. Another change will be the thin, metal legs giving way to the massive brass or gold-plated ones. An alternative will be furniture in heavy shapes of a cube or cylinder.</p>
<h4>Exceptional formats and unique shapes</h4>
<p>The sphere of decorations will be dominated by the apparently mismatched materials. Various decorations will be trendy, though in limited amounts. A brass candle holder, a stone table, some linen cushions and a paper lamp are enough to make the whole arrangement look trendy and smart. Stone will be one of the dominant materials in interiors besides terazzo, breaking the stereotype of tastelessness and datedness.</p>
<p>The last year&#8217;s queen, the grey, is becoming outdated. We abandon also the omnipresent white, so loved by everyone. No more minimalism and coldness! There will be no wall hangings, macrames succulents as well as golden rose or copper-coloured components.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White in combination with strong colours brings to mind lightness, simplicity and modernity. It is completed by toned-down colours and references to nature by using natural materials such as wood, concrete or wool. That characterizes the Scandinavian design loved by millions of people around the world. It is the style for those, who like to take a deep breath when entering their home. Although Scandinavia is associated with cold weather, Scandinavian interiors are bright and cosy. They are the so-called windows to the world, filled with light and space.</p>
<p>A big advantage of this style is functionality. Simple furniture, lamps or accessories are beautiful, perfectly match the interior and are great to use. They can be used in a living room, kitchen or bedroom. Simplicity goes hand in hand with elegance. All objects are integral elements of the interior and give it its unique character. All these small things improve our mood and give us joy. That is the magic of hygge philosophy – enjoying small things and positive attitude.</p>
<p>This way we created flats, where you can feel exceptional and comfortable. Like home. That’s the way Wellcome Home flats are – it doesn’t take much to feel comfortable. Just your photos and favourite mug and you’re at home.</p>
